0,1,0,0,Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more ... 3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it.
1,5,0,0,Looks as good as the picture Didn't use it long so I can't attest to that but for the price it is extremely good looking and feels like a quality build. Just know it's small - you will not be nuking turkeys in this - and it's not super high wattage so it may take a bit longer. So if you must have your canned soup in 2-1/2 minutes and not 3 then this won't work.

9,2,1,1,"It had great reviews when we ordered it The finish is nice and matches our stainless steel/black wall oven nicely. However, the button to open the door no longer opens on the first try or needs some help. And occasionally something internal to the microwave makes a noise when the tray is rotating."
10,5,0,0,"Great little microwave! Excellent small microwave!  I recently moved to an apartment which did not have a built-in microwave, but also a kitchen that wasn't that big.  This microwave was perfect for it.  Its footprint is small, however it packs a punch.  All my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly.  The only downside is that when opening or closing the door, the whole microwave sometimes may move as it's not the heaviest out there, but I'm not going to fault it for that, I just simply put my other hand on top of it while opening/closing."

13,3,0,1,I never used this for my wife insisted we buy ... I never used this for my wife insisted we buy a new microwave after I bought this. I did contact GE and they gave me a 20$ credit  and said not to worry about  paint peeling off. Tell that to your wife! That was OK because I read some reviews which made it sound alittle difficult to use.
15,5,1,1,"... for about a week and so far it's been great; the microwaving powder is quite strong Had this for about a week and so far it's been great; the microwaving powder is quite strong; but the grill plate is too high for some bulkier food, that would be my only complain."
16,1,5,7,I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun. the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door.  At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating.  So sadly we had to send it back.  I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun.
17,5,1,2,"This is a funny story. This is a funny story....years ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for $25.00!  It was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely SMALL kitchen with very little counter space etc.  Recently I moved to a older home, new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space. No room for an over the range microwave. My new little Whirlpool Cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen!  Love it, Love it, Love it....however $25.00 would have been an easier price on the pocket book! LOL"
18,4,0,0,"Love to nuke Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume. But the size is right for me regardless. Certainly this was the best buy on Amazon for my purposes."

25,3,1,2,"Danby 1.1 cuft microwave good unit Unit is lighter than expected. Cooks as expected. Door latch is hard to push, but not hard enough to move unit while opening. Light comes on as unit runs, not as door opens. Buttons are convenient for cooking, but read directions, some difference to set power levels, than other microwaves I have owned. Went with this unit, due to reviews, size and price."

32,4,47,53,"Gap on the top right I just received mine and, when it's running, you can see the interior light shinning through a gap on the top corner. Not sure if this is normal or safe, so I've submitted a question about it. For now, I'll give it a 3 star review for looks and the slightly annoying BANG! the door makes when it closes, pending any heating and an answer to my question. I'll update then. I'm attaching pictures of the gap.<br /><br />UPDATE (9/26/2015): Well, the gap doesn't seem to be a normal feature, but it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way. I mostly use it for heating up leftovers and it works great for that purpose, have not tried it for any serious cooking. The loud door is far more tolerable now after a few uses, barely noticeable. Updating my review to 4 stars, won't do five only because of that gap."

I love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem.  I couldn't be happier.  It is the great same size, the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave. Would not hesitate to purchase this again! Totally worth the price."
40,5,0,1,Five Stars Love LG products. Got product in a timely manner.
41,3,2,2,"Nothing special, but fits the bill. Works well enough for my purposes. Just the right size. I dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds (start) and minutes (number buttons). It's also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy. What brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves ¨C?super tiny, and the handle. While this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well, that doesn't make for a good combination for opening the door. So I have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door. I think this could be solved with some super rubber feet, but I shouldn't have to add them myself."

46,1,6,9,"it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room ... It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions.  I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express, it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds.  Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work.  The surface light and the vent fan works fine.  I really should try it before I install it.  Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one.<br /><br />I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company.  Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company.  I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online."
48,5,1,1,"Easy install.  Looks great.  Works great. Lighter than the GE one it replaced.  Easy, simple to use TouchPad.  Installation was easy and I am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances.  I usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right.  You just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place."

64,5,0,0,"Love it! I was reluctant to get a microwave because of limited counter space that I have in my tiny apartment, so I talked myself out of not needing a microwave. But then I realize how convenient it is to have one and found this one that's just the right size, that's when I knew I had to get it. But don't let its size fool you...it can fit a full sized dinner plate. Five star for sleek design and function. Love it!"
65,5,0,0,"Great price, great microwave The microwave does what it's supposed to do and is easy to use. I like the express settings so when you press any single digit it automatically puts in that amount of minutes. It is great for urban kitchen needs. For smaller kitchens, doesn't take up too much space or for bringing up flights of stairs it is nice and light. Really compact, heats up food well. Great for the price."
66,4,2,2,"Very good but smelly Our microwave was working fine, but had a number of rusty spots.  I cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal.  There was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior.  i.e. to give a uniform color appearance.  The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out.  You could still smell it a couple of weeks later.  But eventually it went away.  Overall, I'm happy.  The 10-yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too."

76,2,21,22,"Not very happy with the new design I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models."

89,5,3,3,"The most adorable little microwave around I only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when I bought my new house and it didn't have a microwave in the kitchen I was kind of like, meh, no biggie. However, after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS. It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. If you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option. But if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you. Have I mentioned how cute it is?!"
90,4,0,0,"Just the right size We replaced our over-the-range microwave with a range hood. We needed a small microwave to install in our pantry and this fit the bill. It holds a 12&#34; plate and has multiple power levels for cooking, but we use it mostly for rewarming. It does take about twice as long as our old microwave but that's okay. One feature I really like is the one-touch button for speed cooking. Start will zap something for 30 seconds on high. 1 = 1 minute, 2 = 2 minutes, etc. That is quick and handy!"

92,4,11,14,"Nice looking This is a nice looking unit. It arrived right on schedule and was well packaged, so no damage. Plus, all the features seem to work. I particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit. My only complaint was, as noted by a couple of others, the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places. Fortunately, I didn't do the install myself, a pro did it--or the micro would have been on the way back to &#34;home&#34;! The unit matches my other LG appliances, so, I'm pretty happy. I'll update this after I've used the micro for a while. Ta. y'all."

Most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me.  It is very attractive - I wanted some stainless to match my other appliances.  I have another Danby product (dehumidifier) and find Danby to be a good product.  In one review I read it said the microwave slid when opening the door - I haven't found this to be a problem at all.

Sometimes it takes a little longer than other microwaves, but for me an extra minute isn't a big deal. For the size and price, it's a fantastic buy.<br /><br />EDIT: Just thought I'd update.

114,4,0,0,"I can have microwave popcorn again What can you say about a part that fits specific applications? It replaced the broken turntable motor in the microwave. Now the microwave doesn't burn things on one side and leave the rest cold. So, it's great that the microwave is works again. The motor was considerably cheaper than having to get a new microwave, which is the best thing about it.<br />It was easy to swap out once the cover was removed from the bottom of the microwave. Getting to the turntable motor in a counter top microwave takes a chisel (or snips, etc.) to cut the tabs holding the cover panel to the sheet metal bottom of the oven. Then it's just a case of removing one screw and unplugging a connector. Just reverse the process and its back in place and you are in business. The cover plate may need a screw to hold it in place when you reassemble the microwave. It wasn't included with the motor, but is easy enough to find at the hardware store (or scavenge from some old, unused electronics)."

118,4,0,0,"Great microwave I have had this microwave for about 5 months now and it is working perfectly. The settings on the front are easy to use, I regularly use the 30 second option on the &#34;start&#34; button, and it cooks evenly. 1100 Watts is good enough for everything I cook and I like the fact that there is a light when you open the door. I think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but I do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute. Plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying (personal preference though). It is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen. I like the look of it too - clean lines! I knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless I hold it with the other hand. Perhaps putting the microwave on a non-slip mat would solve that issue."

Maybe for some folks, having a door that latches so tight you have to hold onto the oven itself when pushing button to open door is a good thing but not for me. Really wish there was a way to adjust this-a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door! And one small note...I haven't figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer, my old one you could and find that to be a feature I miss-have written to Danby to ask if I'm missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond. UPDATE: Danby took over a week to respond but it's as I feared-you cannot set timer and still use microwave to cook-OH WELL but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave. And make sure that when you check a review for Danby microwave, it is for the actual model you are looking at-Amazon has chosen to lump ALL Danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 1.1 and 1000 watt, some reviews are all the way down to the .7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews."

Hence, I purchased the one above- almost an exact replacement. It works very well and is easy to use, but I am not happy with the outward appearance. Too much black and it looks cheap compared to her original one."

I read some negative reviews - all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it? Well duh. I have a 5yo and 8yo - they know not to stand on/in the microwave. And it's 2015 - who needs a revolving plate? I use a microwave for quick stuff, not rotisserie chicken and what-not.

252,3,1,1,"just ok I've had this item for about a month. It was purchased to replace an aging micro/convection that I've had for about 8 years. While I've not yet used all the various settings,  I have used the microwave function. More to that in a minute.<br />When I received this item, the box didn't show any damage, but the micro had a sizable dent in the exterior upper back part of one of the side panels. Returning the item seemed like a huge pain (one of the problems with ordering this type of merchandise from an on line source), so I called Amazon customer service and they gave me a credit for the damage.<br />On to the performance of the unit.... It does work well as a microwave, however it is louder than any microwave I've ever had in the past (including the micro/convection that I bought this one to replace.) Is this a problem associated with the dent in the housing? Perhaps.<br />Now, the reason I've only used the micro function? I just haven't had the time to dig thru the manual to figure out how to use the other functions. It really is not very intuitive when it comes to ease of use. Also, while I knew that it had a wheel for time adjustment, I didn't realize how much I'd gotten use to simply entering the time digitally. I know this sounds like a petty complaint, but one would think that as technology advances, we wouldn't be taking backward steps in product design. I'll add more as I have the time to decipher the instructions for more functions."

270,5,3,3,"This Danby model is perfect for that I wanted a small microwave to heat food more than cook it in the first place. For example, I bake a large casserole in my oven, keep it in the fridge, then later heat meal-sized portions. This Danby model is perfect for that. Occasionally, I'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch (or so) interior rotating cooking surface.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of, and that is this is a 700 watt microwave. Most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves. This means you must cook things longer with 700 watts. No problem: Do an internet search for &#34;microwave 700 watt conversion chart&#34; and you'll see plenty of charts you can print. I posted one I printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when I need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt Danby. Example: 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave.<br /><br />This is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power. It may no be for everyone. However, it meets my needs exactly. Also, it looks and performs well. I have had no problems with it. I'm a satisfied customer."

We would have returned the microwave IF he hadn't already put it in the truck and left from home BEFORE he discovered that it doesn't work on the power source (why not... we still don't know).  Looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal.<br /><br />We gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it DOES work if you want to use it in a house, but for some reason will not work with the power inverter OTR trucks use."
282,3,3,3,"Ok, but some options are limited and the instructions are somewhat obtuse. Works fine, but somewhat lacking in some features.  The defrost selection begins at  1/2 lbs..  In a single person household, I often need to defrost smaller amounts.  I buy packages of pork chops, vegetables, etc. and split them up into small packages and freeze them.  Also, my previous microwave had a 30 second time add feature which I used more often than the 1 minute add feature on this microwave.  One minute is often longer than I need and if 30 seconds is too short, I could always push it more than once.  That microwave also had several fan speeds and light options.  The lower fan speeds were useful when I didn't need the higher speed and reduced the rather irritating high speed fan noise.  These restrictions are mostly just somewhat irritating and, overall, I'm not dissatisfied with the unit.  I also found the installation instructions somewhat difficult to follow. Mainly, I had a few parts that didn't seem to go anywhere.  My previous unit (different maker) only lasted 4 years which was a disappointment, I hope this one lasts longer."

288,1,5,6,TREMENDOUS HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND BACK.  DANGEROUS! THIS GIVES OFF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK.  Simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm.  I then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat.  Since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous!  Especially if you have children.  I am returning it immediately.

It arrived without the internal clock, it is completely missing, so obviously it didn't function out of the box. And I can't get a replacement for another week, this is awful. I know microwaves are just a convenience but having just moved we don't have one and this was timed to arrive just in time for our new home. Total disappointment in both the product and Amazon."

296,5,8,8,"Fits exactly as the other reviewers measured It fits perfectly under my cabinets - the measurements given by everyone are accurate! I was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment, but it runs with just a small dimming of lights. WHEW. It heats nicely and is quite spacious. The only annoying thing is that start/stop are the same button, but &#34;cancel&#34; is a tiny button near the top of the panel. So often I go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again. I am used to cancel/stop being the same button! I'll reprogram myself. In the meantime, I love it.<br /><br />Side note: There is a cardboard-y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual - LEAVE IT THERE. If you go to the manufacturer's website, you can find out it's a mica panel to protect a vent. It's tempting to toss it because it looks out of place with the rest of the shiny chrome, but just leave it."

323,1,24,29,"The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire ... I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again."

388,2,2,2,"Stylish but not reliable, poor customer service as experienced by many others Several Samsung appliances looked interesting (features/appearances) when we were upgrading our appliances. Then I found a problem after diving into the customer reviews - the overall ratings are good, but for customers who give them low rates have catastrophic failures, e.g. smoking induction ranges, more than other brands.  We decided to stay away from Samsung brand for our major purchases. As we got most of our appliances sorted out, we still need a microwave. This one, again, looked interesting. I thought ok how bad can it be? Its neither too heavy nor too expensive, let's take a risk on this one. But I was wrong.  Long story short, after one month, the turntable starts to make noise. After 3 repair attempts over several weeks, we were left with the turntable not turning at all. To add to the insult, these 3 repair attempts don't even register in Samsung's system, so even if the lemon law is more and more applicable to my case, I would have trouble claiming it.  Based what I found after taking apart of our broken Samsung TV, I think the company put too much emphasis on using their own components, and some of them are not very good. That could be why we are seeing a pattern of reliability problems across its product lines."
389,5,0,0,"Perfect for me! I love this little microwave!  I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  After coming across this one, I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - What if it was actually TOO small? & #2 - It didn't have the crazy power of my last one & I'm impatient.  Alas, I bit the bullet & have been VERY happy with it ever since!  I've realized that I never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  I usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever I want it to be & let it go.  I would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as I, as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen."

Sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. Dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years. The product came quickly and I was very happy. I would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect."

I love the easy automatic open/close feature and not having to bend down to put items in the microwave. The unit holds much larger plates and platters than I was able to put in my former microwave, which is really nice. It also has many useful features such as a sensor that can tell how much an item needs to be heated to be ready. As this was part of a kitchen remodel I simply told the product number to our kitchen cabinet company and they made the cabinets such that it would fit in perfectly as a built in.  The item fits in well with our suite of other stainless steel appliances.  No complaints. I highly recommend."

I was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem, but since the magnetron (in my oven) was 10 years old, I figured that might be the problem. However (after installing the new kit) my General Electric (JEM31WA  002) was still not functioning. So, I ordered new door switches (and after checking my old oven switches) I learned that the &#34;bottom&#34; (Normally open) door switch was not functioning. So, I changed it out, and &#34;voila,&#34; my microwave is functioning perfectly! It took some time, but it is worth it! I don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode (as my old ones were probably on their way out, anyway! (I had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube.

454,5,1,3,"Custom Looking Built-In Microwave That Works Great! I purchased this drawer microwave from Amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home.  My wife couldn't understand why I wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn't think the whole &#34;drawer thing&#34; was a good idea.  She eventually (reluctantly) agreed because she didn't want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design.  Once it was installed, she said she liked the looks of it (built into the island).  Everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it's kind of unique.  When my wife used it the first time I don't think she wanted to admit I actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it's easy to get cookware in and out since it's waist high with the door open.  My adult son used the &#34;sensor reheat&#34; button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat.  The feature evidently &#34;senses&#34; the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it's ready.  Pretty cool feature!  I love the microwave.  It adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great.  (I think my wife even smiled one time when she used it)"
456,3,4,5,The microwave/oven features are great. Very easy to use and looks great Steel case was damaged on back side.  Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet.  The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful.  The microwave/oven features are great.  Very easy to use and looks great!
457,1,2,3,"UPDATE.  Danby died taking electrical plug with it Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily????????<br /><br />I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator - only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the &#34;open&#34; bar enough to get the thing open, the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in.<br /><br /> UPDATE March 6, 2015 -  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review, the nonslip sits unopened.  Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.  Meanwhile, from the punching, the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool  Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time.  Instead, that starts &#34;express&#34; time of minutes for the number I touched."

However, after using this microwave I can say that it works well and, while some its components are plastic, it seems pretty well constructed to me. The grilling feature, (the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the soften/melt feature are nice. I tried the soften/melt feature, for example, and it worked fine. I also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem. The only real problem I can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops. If this is not a problem for you then I recommend this microwave, otherwise, I recommend looking for a smaller microwave."

This one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work, or back into the kitchen, and fit under my standard height cabinets very well. Be advised that this requires a 20 amp GFI outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove. This isn't hard to work out, because chances are in a newer house, your existing vent hood has electrical for it's fan and light. Watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine."
469,5,4,4,"Really nice microwave that also grills and functions like an oven My husband has been using this for the past month in his high school classroom, and his students have been using it every day to warm things up.  It's already been getting a lot of use, and is holding up great so far. Of course, I know it hasn't been used that long, so I'll be sure to update my review as they use it more.<br /><br />The nicest features of this are:<br /><br />* It's a microwave that also grills and crisps food -- so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave.  It comes with a grill rack, and you can cook meat on it.  When you use the grill function, you can put metal into the microwave . . . but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper. The gill function works fine, but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does.<br /><br />*  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas, and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked.<br /><br />* The 1,000 watts make this pretty powerful.  It's good at evenly cooking food, and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do.<br /><br />*  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button, so you can easily add more time to your cooking time.<br /><br />* A standard variety of pre-set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn, veggies, and potatoes.<br /><br />* The exterior has a scratch-resistant coating, and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does.<br /><br />The measurements on the 1.1 cubic foot microwave are: 11-11/16 H by 20-3/8 W by 15-13/16 D in inches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really nice microwave.  As I mentioned at the start of my review, I will update this as my husband and his students use this more, but, so far, they've really liked it and it's held up well to constant use."
470,3,11,18,Shrunk in shipment ... WOW am I ever surprised! The product descriptions states &#34;Spacious 2.0 cu. ft. interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items&#34; this spacious interior is in reality 1.4 cubic feet!!!. LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity .. if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid! Well so much for honesty in advertising ... I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped.

479,3,3,9,"It's Big The first thing you should know about this microwave is that it is big,so make sure you have adequate counter space to accommodate it. I only use it for simple things like heating things up quicky. For this it works well. I haven't yet tried its grilling feature."
480,4,5,5,"A microwave for those who want to cook more than just popcorn, TV Dinners and quesadillas Samsung Countertop Microwave, 1.1 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel is a must buy for people who enjoy cooking meals in their microwaves instead of just zapping snacks and melting cheese.  The counter top microwave is larger than most models and this one can cook main course meals and side dishes for you and your family.  A medium sized pizza can be cooked inside it's designed to &#34;crisp&#34; instead of being kind of on the soft side like other microwaves.  Just press the easy-to-use preset buttons for all of your cooking needs and if you want to &#34;grill&#34; your food with the grill layer that works similar to the one found in a convection oven but don't expect the same results.<br /><br />Overall, I have to recommend this microwave for those who prefer to cook their meals the fast and easy way instead of using a cumbersome stove or for apartment dwellers.  You can't go wrong with a Samsung Countertop Microwave, 1.1 Cubic Feet, Stainless Steel, especially if the price is right."
482,4,6,8,"Do you really need to grill in your microwave? This is a powerful and great looking counter top microwave. It's replaced my old 1000 watt sanyo. It has some features you don't find on many microwaves including a power saving mode (which turns off the LED clock), a grilling element on the top, and ceramic plate. In theory you could cook a pizza, heat up some bacon all while retaining the crispiness. I'd probably heat up frozen egg rolls before i do the any of the prior though. The grilling feature is gimmicky to me. First you lose height for reheating taller items. And I'm not one for having an issue using the oven for a frozen pizza or a pan for your bacon. Maybe even a toaster oven if you wanna reheat those chicken mcnuggets. There's also one more minor issue. The rotating glass plate is raised a bit too high around the edges than i'm used to. So make sure you lift your item high enough to clear the glass plate when taking anything out."
483,4,1,1,"Excellent color match Works exactly as advertised in my GE Profile microwave. Color match is darned near exact. I prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible. Then sprayed in many coats to get coverage. I removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips¡ªcould just as easily remove a star from the painter (me). The paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth. Nonetheless, I will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the GE oven. Cleans nicely, and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />1 can will likely cover about ? of a microwave interior adequately. Since my oven was flaking, I needed about this much coverage or slightly less. If I had stripped the entire interior, I would have been short."

First you have to push one of them, then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button. That is 3-touch, not 1! I bought this for my parents in their nineties. No way they can use this. It's going back. P.S. The inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean."

I sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry. I probably sprayed 20 coats. You could smell the new paint for a couple of days. It has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping.  Good product.
502,5,0,0,Worth the extra price Great microwave. It is much more expensive than the typical small microwave but is worth it for something of better quality and at least some elegance of design. Controls are simple and light to the touch. I don't miss having a numeric keypad.

504,4,2,3,"Good looking, silent and functional I bought Danby Designer 1.1 cu.ft microwave to replace my aging and faulty Sharp Carousal which served well for 7 years. On comparing against my Sharp unit I found this few pounds lighter. But the marked difference which was noticed is the noise level. While Sharp was really a rowdy teenager this guy is really a silent one. When measured with smartphone sound meter app, the operational level was about 65dB ( which is like normal conversational level). I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason - my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue. As for functions, besides the common controls like popcorn,pizza,beverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful. There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level. There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control - $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter. There is a two step cooking, which essentially step down the power for the second round - yet to try this feature.<br />Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial. The wheeled base where the tray rest and the spoke on which tray slots fits looks a bit fragile, probably because of the lack of finish on the molds.<br />Overall this is a very elegant and industrial looking microwave and so far a great addition to my counter top."
505,1,0,0,"Beware. Do not buy this.  You would get better value by throwing money out into the street.  Mine lasted three weeks, and then became entirely useless.  If you buy one of these and pay for it, you will end up with no money and no microwave."

508,5,814,848,"THE WORLD'S MOST MISUNDERSTOOD KITCHEN APPLIANCE? I've written quite a few product reviews in the past, but never have I seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance! A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here. Try it for yourself and I would bet that you won't be disappointed.n to $199.99 with free shipping.

509,5,0,0,"Includes Toaster Grill... As far as microwave cookers go, this beats everything else because it includes a toaster grill. I really prefer using the toaster grill rather than the microwave even if it takes much longer to cook... so it's perfect for me. This unit looks really slick and it's so easy to use. Very intuitive. It's about twice the price of other units but this is a high quality Samsung product. I love it.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
510,4,5,5,"A Multi-Function Unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect! (The preheat setting is problematic to say the least) I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility. That said, the unit is not without issues.<br /><br />The short story is: the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit. The grill function is great - provided you use the pan that comes with the unit. The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit. (FIRE!) The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off, especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting. The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built. The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made.<br /><br />Now for those who are interested, the long story:<br /><br />Microwave:<br /><br />Works just great, seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit. The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit.<br /><br />Grill:<br /><br />Love this feature, I made the following - Grilled Cheese (upper rack and pan - 7 minutes with flip at half way point) turned out beautifully. Open face bagel with cheese (upper rack and pan - 5 minutes) grilled to perfection.<br /><br />Convection Oven:<br /><br />I had pretty good but not perfect results here: Baked Russet Potatoes (medium) were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting, my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting. Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well, they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven. Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result. French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper - the paper caught fire. I checked the manual about using parchment paper - I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking - and there was no warning about using it - but I can tell you it is a big no-no.<br /><br />Preheat Function:<br /><br />Well, this function is pretty worthless on my unit. I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit. The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire, the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up. The next time we used it, it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down. (It completely turns off, including the time display and will not work at all.) The next time I let it cycle through (both the preheat and 10 minute cycle), the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards. Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook - the unit shut down again. As I said, we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done. Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey, sometimes the unit remains functional, sometimes it shuts down. The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use.<br /><br />Slim Fry:<br /><br />We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do, perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries!<br /><br />Overall, this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be. I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units (toaster oven/convection oven) have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best. The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side. (Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs. regular oven on this unit and you should be fine.)  For the price the unit seems a solid investment, my only reservation being the preheat function which I think I will just chose to not use going forward.<br /><br />Recommended with above reservations."

516,5,104,117,"This Combination Microwave Is Worth the Extra Cost Is a combination microwave oven worth the extra cost?  This SAMSUNG COUNTER TOP GRILL MICROWAVE certainly is.  I've used the &#34;combi&#34; button (30% microwave power combined with a single-temperature top heating element) along with the &#34;crusty plate&#34; and grill rack to cook bacon, hamburgers, and frozen hamburgers.  All came out tasting like grilled meats (not microwaved meats).<br /><br />The regular microwave features work like any standard microwave.  The interior is easy to clean.  The microwave door is a mirror that takes a little getting used to (see the attached photo).  The only thing I don't like about this appliance is that the mirrored door won't allow you to watch your food while it's cooking.<br /><br />This is a beautiful kitchen appliance that performs the function of both a microwave and a toaster oven.  But everything cooks with the speed of a microwave.  At 950 watts, the microwave is a little less powerful than my old 1000-watt Sears microwave, so I need to set it for slightly longer cooking and reheating times.<br /><br />***Cleaning Tip:  If you grill bacon, you'll get grease splatter on the roof of the microwave.  Bon Ami removes this easily, without scratching the interior."
517,5,5,5,"Get crispy food - in your microwave! We live out in the country where we are forced to use propane for heat - and we have a gas-powered oven - so we usually don't make pizza at home due to the cost of propane - and most pizzas are too large to fit into our toaster oven. Additionally, when it's hot outside, cooking something in the oven turns our whole house into an inferno - so we live out of the microwave. Being able to cook a frozen pizza and have it be crispy - from the microwave, is so nice. It doesn't seem to ever get to the point where it gets it as crispy as I'd like it - but I do like just about everything burned to a crisp - I'm odd that way.<br /><br />Because of the grill element on the top, there is not as much height clearance as we had in our previous model - but for the vast majority of things we cook, this is not an issue.<br /><br />The stainless steel finish is a nice modern update to our kitchen. This model has a lot of power for a compact unit."

This Samsung Counter Top Microwave seems like a nice starter microwave.  It's not incredibly large, but for one person, it works fine.  There are a number of pre-set cook options that could come in handy. We tested this on the frozen dinner setting.  The frozen dinner box was supposed to cook for a shorter time period than the microwave's pre-set, but only by a small amount.  The cook was even and overall, it tasted good! As far as looks go, this is a sleek little microwave.  It seems to get dirty easily, though, especially the button used to open the door.

527,3,182,192,"Takes your chef skills down a few notches I¡¯m always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling ¨C which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called ¡°oil-less¡± fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald¡¯s, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I¡¯d still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don¡¯t know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It¡¯s part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the ¡°we¡¯ll let you know when it will be done when we¡¯re ready to let you know¡± feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

529,5,3,4,"Exceeds expectations Setting it up it is the only issue.  It is very specifically for counter-top use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord.  The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave.  Expect to need an extension cord.  The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average, but not much.  It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened, which may be a problem for larger dishes, but I've yet to encounter an issue.  There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open.  It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen, and does so in all four modes (microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and toaster oven/grill).  There is no timer, which I found odd, but I've been using the phone for that for so long, I barely notice.<br /><br />The settings make it super easy to use.  You can auto-reheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature.  There is a convenient popcorn button.  I've heard stories of a friend without that feature trying to pop up a bag of microwave popcorn.  Six people.  One microwave.  No viable popcorn.  No such problem here.  One button and let it pop.<br /><br />There are also auto-cook features for pasta, beverage, chicken breast, frozen breakfast, and frozen dinner.  What? No frozen lunch?<br /><br />The air fry (or slim fry, however you want to call it) feature worked well for me, though I only tried homemade french fries.  It only works for this list of pre-programmed items:<br /><br />Frozen oven chips (aka french fries)<br />Frozen breaded prawns<br />Frozen chicken nuggets<br />Frozen potato croquettes<br />Frozen onion rings<br />Chicken wings<br />Homemade french fries (there is a recipe in the guide and it's good to read it first if you've never air fried these before)<br />Potato wedges<br />Drumsticks<br /><br />For using it as a toaster oven, or grill (it seems like they use the terms interchangeably) you put the thing you want to toast/grill on the high rack (included, as is the lower rack) and select grill.  For medium dark toast, I go three minutes on each side.  It comes it shockingly good, same as from any toaster.  I had low expectations for that one, but it worked really well.<br /><br />Overall, it does everything it says it does, and it does it very well."

534,4,2,4,"Really like the microwave, a bit torn on the other features First off, my family and I are very happy with the microwave portion of the Samsung Counter Top Convection Microwave.  It looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances.  The black ceramic interior is also a nice touch - looks great and should be easy to clean.  The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced, and in operation the microwave is very quiet.  One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there - rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range.  However, it is sufficient for home cooking tasks.  Setting the power and time is easy.<br /><br />The other function we've tried is the convection oven.  We used it to cook some frozen hors d'oeuvres (fancy name for pigs in a blanket) using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate.  Even though we preheated the oven as directed, we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package, so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven.  In addition, the exterior of the unit becomes *very* hot when using this mode.  I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often, though it is a nice feature to have.<br /><br />As for the Slim Fry / grilling / combined cooking modes, I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will.  These modes *seem* to use both microwave and convection heating, but it isn't clear how much of each from the very short included manual.  It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used.  (Even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that Samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject.)  In any event, I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying.  As for grilling, the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven, and I'm not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.<br /><br />So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking, three stars for convection cooking, and two stars for the other functions.  Four stars overall since it does its main job very well.h the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.

540,4,3,3,"It comes with metal racks? What next? A TV without a dial? To address the leading question:<br /><br />Yes, metal racks. That work, during the use of the microwave function. And the universe does not condense into a singularity and explode. What else from my childhood has changed? Do you no longer have to turn the dial on a phone to make a call?

Follow the instructions.<br /><br />Here's the skinny:<br /><br />This is more than just a microwave. You can see in the description all of the functions--and they all work pretty close to as they are described.<br /><br />That's the first real issue with the &#34;Smart Oven,&#34; as the box labels it: the descriptions on the webpage here? They're almost as complete as the instruction manual. There's a bit more, but overall I would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it. Especially with the concepts/cooking types involved. I think the Slim-Fry concept is great, but I'd like to understand how it's working better so that I can do more than chicken wings and fries.<br /><br />You will also note several comments on the lack of timer. It's true: no &#34;non-cooking timer.&#34;<br /><br />In exchange, though, you can actually generate a crispy crust on that microwave pizza.<br /><br />The drop-down door is nice, but keep it in mind as you handle placement. On a countertop, it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave.<br /><br />Functionally, I'd like a better option when using the grill or Slim-Fry settings than letting the grease/food drippings to just drop down onto the turntable. Especially because that thing gets wicked hot (as is reasonable) so you have to wait a while to pull it and clean it.<br /><br />But the functions work well, so that's the main thing.<br /><br />In all...great oven.

544,5,116,122,"Awesome Convection Microwave Oven! Before this microwave found its place on my counter this week, I hadn't known how much I would love it!  It heats food quickly, is easy to use (once you review the manual), and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do.<br /><br />What makes this microwave different...<br />+ It has many possibilities.<br />+ Pizza is crispy on the bottom (when reheated) even on the microwave setting!<br />+ It can be simple, or you can dive into all the stuff it can do!<br />+ The size is comparable to our old 1.1 cu ft microwave, yet it can do more.<br />+ The colors are awesome!  The stainless is only on the front (which makes for less to clean) and the gray top and sides are not stainless---so they will keep cleaner.<br />+ The dials and quick microwave settings are smart.  To reheat something for 30 seconds, just press the button on the bottom right (once for 30 seconds, twice for a minute, etc.).  Or, press the microwave button, turn the dial to the time you'd like (backwards or forwards) and then press the start button.<br />+ The clock setting is easy to set.<br />+ The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees.  Preheat the oven first, and then select the convection oven.  You'll need to read the directions in the manual first, but then it's easy to navigate from there on out.<br />+ The oven includes a crispy plate, two wire racks (that worked great on the convection setting), a glass plate and ring.  I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy.<br /><br />What may concern you...<br />-  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit (not on a power cord).  It does not have a long cord, so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it.<br />-  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe.  One review for this microwave was mistaken--they said you couldn't use plastic in it.  Not true.  You just have to use microwave safe materials.  There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual (which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it).<br />- The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven, so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving.  Otherwise, it's going to be a pain to clean it up.<br /><br />Other matters to address...<br />It's always interesting to read other people's reviews.  One reviewer didn't like the manual, because a cookbook wasn't included.  Honestly, I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them.  The manual for this oven seems small, but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use it--and more.  No recipes, but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables, reheating foods, etc.  I don't cook in my microwave oven normally.  I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven, though, on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly!<br /><br />Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven.  That's not true actually.  If you use the microwave function, the time counts down normally.  If you use the convection setting, you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done.  If you find you need a few extra minutes, it's very easy to turn it right back on.  To use the convection oven, you do need to preheat the oven first, but that's not a problem.  One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it, the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button (so the time didn't keep going either).  Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this microwave.  It covers the basics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.  But, the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me!  Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all.  I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove, so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess.

552,4,1,1,"I love this microwave so much I love this microwave so much! Aesthetically, it's the coolest kitchen appliance I own. It's also pretty powerful. That said, it's kinda small inside and square plates, 16 oz coffee cups, and popcorn bags can pose difficulties (e.g., when the popcorn bag starts to fill up, the tray stops turning). I still wouldn't trade it in!"

557,4,3,3,"Great value for money and does everything it promises! This is a very versatile microwave. The basic functions of a microwave - heating, reheating, defrosting - all are performed excellently. But this unit does so much more - it comes with stacking parts that allow you to heat or reheat two plates simultaneously, which is extremely convenient. Best of all, it is a convection microwave, so you can pretty much do everything you would need with this microwave - bake a cake, broil, etc. You can cook fried items in a manner that limits oiliness. I like the pull down door, rather than the open out variety - that function saves space, actually. Decently sized - a little smaller than my previous microwave, but as much size as you could need. Stainless steel is great - matches the rest of my kitchen - and its a high-ended looking device. Very solid, well built, good value for money and does everything it promises."

Yes it is small but, that is what I needed and what I am used to. I can't get my largest dinner plate in but, I can get my smaller ones in. I love how the back is rounded. I had a Sharp Half Pint that finally died after 24 yrs. This has way more features than the Sharp. I have very little counter space so, thank goodness I found this. Yes, it is pricey but, well worth the money to me. UPDATE &#62;&#62;&#62;I  purchased it 12/20/14 and it died April 3rd/2015. Whirlpool has been  very nice and will be sending a replacement."

562,3,1,2,"Adequate, but noisy Since we only use a microwave to heat or reheat food, I decided to forgo all the bells and whistles when our last one stopped working. This one was the lowest priced one that met the color, size and wattage I wanted.<br />Pros: Heats food as expected.<br />Cons: Noisy<br />While the microwave works fine for it's intended purpose, it's extremely noisy compared to our previous microwaves and occasionally makes an odd rumbling sound which may be from it not sitting level since one leg is shorter than the others. I attempted to adjust the leg without success so tucked a piece of folded cardboard under it to keep the microwave somewhat level. Also at first the door was extremely difficult to push open, but that has gotten better with use."
563,2,1,2,"Overheats with minimal use! This microwave OVERHEATS if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn!  Once it overheats, it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available, thus making it take forever to heat anything. You have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down.<br /><br />The microwave works well if you don't use it too much at once.  But for more intensive use, buy something more powerful!!"

570,1,6,7,I said fine and went and bought another microwave [[VIDEOID:567df035967d824cead7d2509901668b]] The unit went out after the initial warranty had expired. The unit was listed as having a 10 year warranty on the Magnetron. The Magnetron (the main engine of the microwave). I jumped thru hopes for weeks (including taking videos of the product shooting flaming sparks) with Samsung warranty service only to be told that they do not have a service agreement near Arkansas. Another week passed and I spoke with them one the phone and they we finally agreed on a partial refund and they sent me an email confirming the amount.<br /> I said fine and went and bought another microwave. They never sent the refund and I called a week later and they said that I had to provide them parts from the original microwave???.......easily done if they had told me this before.!!  They never said a word about it either on the phone or email.<br />This unit should last longer than it did. I feel stupid that I have bought a kitchen full of Samsung appliances. Now if/when these break I will have to deal with the same deceptive people and lack of support again.....Steer clear !!

585,1,27,30,"A Whirlpool Lemon I purchased this microwave in February, 2014. It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.  Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties, at least not for this product.<br /><br />P.S. 10 days after this review was posted, Whirlpool issued a refund check."

594,3,5,6,"Your results may vary Paint itself seems to work well -- depending upon WHERE you paint.  If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.  Some foods, such as potatoes, generate a lot of steam/moisture in the oven -- which drained UNDER the turntable.  I didn't always notice the moisture, and that's what caused the rusting in the first place."

I'm having a kitchen remodel and didn't want to build in a microwave, which--let's face it--is mostly a giant water boiling machine.  I got this little one to use during my remodel and I plan to use it once my kitchen's remodeled, too.  The time goes up in increments of 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1:30, 2 minutes, etc.  I wondered if that would work for me, but it's just fine.  I also found out, however, that the power goes up in increments 25, 50, 75, 100. Sometimes, I use my microwave to &#34;soften&#34; butter and I need the lower power of 10.  If the microwave offered increments of 10, 20, 30, etc., it would be perfect.  Because it doesn't, I may have to take this one to work and get myself a different microwave for home."

663,5,18,18,"Very nice range, good choice for 5-burner double oven Very much enjoying this range! I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grill/griddle. We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup.<br /><br />The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I, but I do expect the large oven will get a work-out at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. The Power Boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS. The main differences:<br /><br />* This model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* The 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 BTU boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 BTU<br />* The 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* The 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (I believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 MSRP price difference<br /><br />To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me. I did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine, but I can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish. The Power Boil is excellent on this, I don't see 10% higher BTU making a tremendous difference.<br /><br />I also considered these other five-burner double-oven ranges: Frigidaire FGGF304DLF, KitchenAid HGRS505XSS, LG LDG3036ST, and Whirlpool WGG7550BS.  All have their benefits and drawbacks but the GE has the largest ovens and I got a good price through Amazon."

736,4,0,1,"Good, so far This was rated fairly high by Consumer Reports, and usage over the past month or so has borne that out. It is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly. The basic controls are fairly intuitive, though apparently I have to set the power level before I set the cook time, rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave. The special features, like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam, are things that I don't seem to be able to get the hang of. After playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad, I was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items. I don't like the push button opener; I think that is what will break first, and then I won't be able to open the door. I do not regret the purchase so far. If the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase."

I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item. It is overpriced, but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working. I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new. Also, the handle is made of plastic, not stainless steel as it appears to be. The Tape (made to look like stainless steel), keeps peeling from the heat of the range, and exposing the plastic more everyday. I have had this microwave for 8 months now, and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone. It is functional, but looks really tacky."

Yeah, it's a little underpowered, but you get used to that.<br /><br />It fits a whole plate, which is nice, but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate. Full-size popcorn bags have this problem for example.<br /><br />But overall, great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space."

It is large enough to heat everything I use a microwave for.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use. The high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts I was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer.  The only minor annoyance I have after several days of use is that I have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven.  My cup measures 6&#34; tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in. However, I found if I remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns, it fits perfectly."

794,5,4,4,Microwave Cavity Paint has worked out great so far!!! This microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far!  We have a GE in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  Be sure to get ALL loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover.  After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat.  I want to make sure it was coated good.  So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  I would take a counter top unit outside to treat.  I didn't have that option so I had to just do it.
795,5,1,1,"IT TALKS TO YOU AND DOES THE JOB love the microvave,especially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigate.heats well-we're very satisfied with it."
796,5,1,1,"Perfect! I love this new little microwave- I had no room in my small kitchen, but I hardly know it's there, it takes up so little space. The only thing I don't like is, there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table- more parts to worry about should they ever get lost. The plate rests on one of the plastic parts (the turner with wheels) which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom- which makes smaller space to fit tall items. There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />The whole unit is easy to clean- ALL, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. It has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee. The only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes- I don't know why the manufacturer would choose &#34;popcorn&#34; when coffee/tea is used much more often. This small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily. I am very happy with this product- so easy to use and clean."
798,4,6,6,A good small microwave This is a truly compact microwave.  I wanted something with a small footprint but functions well.  This oven has fit the bill.  It sits in a corner on my counter.  As some have mentioned you can't program the time you want but have to hit the controls to add 5 seconds or 30 seconds.  This aspect is not ideal but also not big large problem.

809,5,7,8,"More units should be available in this shape and size... Look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape. If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space."

The size as well is perfect for cooking anything microwavable.

854,4,6,8,Good value/small issue Microwave performs as expected and was a good value. Only complaint is with the alarm that sounds when the timer is complete. 5beeps is a bit much and the alarm does not stop even if you open the door until those 5 beeps are complete. Small issue but annoying all the same.
855,4,6,8,pretty good lil microwave its a microwave and it works like a microwave. Nothing fancy has the quick start buttons. Was the cheapest 1000w one I found and I have no complaints.
856,1,2,3,Worst EVER!! This is the worst microwave I have ever owned.  It takes twice as long to heat food.  We also have owned it for only a few months and the key pad broke.
858,5,0,0,"This fixed my microwave Works as advertised.  Much cheaper than a service call or a completely new microwave.  Just be sure you know how to confirm the problem so you know which part has failed (search youtube).  An oven that won't heat is often, but not always, a failed magnetron."
859,5,1,7,GOOD DEAL LOVE IT!!!!!  I AM HAPPY WITH MY  PURCHASE<br /> AND LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT DEAL.<br />KEEP THE DEALS CINUBG.  LOL
860,5,0,0,"Sharp R-1405 Microwave oven Arrived in two days instead of the week as reported, this was a great plus. It fit into the same spot as old Sharp, another plus. The mounting brackets were in a different location & constructed less sturdy than the old ones. The medal was cheaply made & much thinner. Overall I am happy with purchase."
861,5,0,0,Great Microwave This is the perfect microwave for my household. It is basically used for heating water and food. Couldn't ask for anything better.
863,4,134,147,"Good Buy So, I needed a basic microwave, nothing fancy. Let's face it, no kitchen can function can live with out one. Don't know how the settlers survived lol. Anyway, it arrived in about a week in perfect condition. And far exceeded my expectations. It looks just like the pic and even displays the time, and has a timer. It cooks very well also. Over all yes, buy it, you won't be disappointed."
864,3,0,0,"Wouldn't buy again. The door wants to catch.  When you push the numbers on the keyboard, they seem cheap.  You have to push hard for them to work right.  This is the second one of same microwave we've had.  Purchased it so wouldn't have to remount hardware.  This second one seems like it's a reject or a second that a store is trying to get rid of."
865,2,1,2,NOZZLE PROBLEMS AFTER I MADE EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS TO PAINT THE CAVITY OF THE MICROWAVE I NOTICED THE NOZZLE HAD A CRACK IN IT THAT I COULD NOT SEE UNTIL I HAD APPLIED THE PAINT. THIS LED TO DRIPPING AND STREAKS IN THE PAINTING PROCESS. IT MADE A TERRIBLE MESS AND THE RESULT WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I WOULD OF HOPED . TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER CAN THAT I COULD USE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED NOZZLE BUT WITH NO RESULTS. MY SUGGESTION IS SPRAY SOMETHING TO TEST HOW WELL THE NOZZLE WORKS BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL APPLIANCE.
866,5,0,0,Whirlpool Microwave This microwave is perfect for a compact kitchen. I have more counter space that is now useable than I had before. It's small foot print is a blessing. It is large enough to accommodate my needs. The interior is spacious enough to reheat dinners or a slice of pizza. I like making popcorn in it. Would recommend this to anyone who has a small kitchen and is need of a unit with a smaller foot print.
867,2,1,1,Magnatron arrived without diode Magnetron came quickly but the diode was not in the package as advertised. I do not want to install the Magnetron without a new diode.
868,5,0,0,"Lovely Small package, but large inside. It will fit a full size plate. Perfect counter microwave. Takes up very little space in the corner. We love it. We have had many comments on how cool it looks from friends."
869,4,0,0,Save on Counter Space I was looking for a more compact microwave because I don't have a lot of counterspace.  This works pretty good for that.  The only thing I didn't like is that the cord is on the back right side instead of in the back middle.  So I was unable to put the microwave in the spot I wanted because it wouldn't reach the outlet.
870,3,0,1,Tippy - Be Careful Nice small size for an out of the way spot on kitchenh shelve under counter.  In opening and closing take great care as it easily l tips forward.
873,3,1,2,"Good performance, suspect reliability This is my second unit, replacing one installed in a custom-built cabinet.  I purchased this one solely for dimensional compatibility.  When working, this microwave is excellent in all respects.  It runs quietly, the controls are intuitive and it boasts a number of cooking programs that generally perform well.  Unfortunately, after 5.2 years in service the first unit failed.  I was told the failed component was the magnetron, an expensive part, so I simply replaced it.  I hope the premature failure of the first unit was an aberration."
875,4,0,1,"Roomy This is pretty roomie, has plenty of power and fits just about anywhere.  It looks like a TV though and is a bit loud."
876,1,5,7,Do not waste your money with this After our GE Caf¨¦ microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
877,5,0,0,Occasional use We got this as a backup when our large microwave broke.  It does a nice job and it's nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it.  The smaller size is really nice and doesn't take up a lot of space.

879,4,0,1,I like it Worked great.
880,5,0,1,Microwave is great.. Works great.. and really great size for cooking multiple items.  easy to use without a lot of fancy buttons. I recommend this to others. But be sure of the size as this is a very large over the stove microwave.
881,5,4,5,"Whirlpool Microwave I love this. The cord is on the right, and short, I could have used the word on the left but other than that (because of my outlet location) it deserves a full 5 stars. It does reach to my outlet, but would have been nicer on the left for the location I have the microwave. Other than that, I love this little microwave, I do have too cook things 30-60 seconds longer however, the space I save it worth the extra cooking time. Heats up food, frozen vegetables, and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly. Fits a full sized plate or paper plate, fits a 10&#34; bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top. This is not for cooking meals, small things only in my opinion and just what I needed and wanted."
882,1,2,4,"not what I thought I was ordering My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways, 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application, by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it. No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full."
883,5,0,0,Spacemaker Over the Range Microwave It is perfect for my needs for space.  Size is good and so far performance has been good The extra rack is a nice addition
884,3,0,0,"little experience with device yet. setup and install directions unbelievably bad Device ok after only 2 weeks except that operating touch panel is not the work of genius and not really touch.<br /><br />Big floppy paper templates for wall and overhead marks should be on or glued to stiff cardboard with perforations for marking. Author of directions too expert to convey simple things, failed to consider ceramic tiles on walls need carbide drills. Directions were accurate tho clumsy."
886,5,0,0,Perfect Exact device needed to solve my GE microwave problem. My wife is happy now ... so I can be happy too!
887,5,2,3,Excellent Price This was an excellent shopping experience.  I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these. Great Shopping Experience.

889,5,5,6,"You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning<br /><br />You'll be fooled at first because usually to fix some appliance, you remove the cover, or case, or housing, or whatever you call it --- the Cabinet.  Don't.  In fact, on a Sharp Microwave, they used some screws to hold on the cabinet that you don't have the wrench for.  It's like saying, &#34;These arent' the screws you're looking for.&#34;  (You don't need to see his identification papers,)<br /><br />The arcane baffling steps that aren't explained anywhere and that you haven't experienced before --<br />1. The little perforated plate near the center of the back, after you turn it upside down, is removed by ripping it away manfully.  Never done that before on ANYTHING.  No screws,  just hack at it.  You'll be thinking, &#34;But if I bend it and twist it, how will it go back on? &#34;  Well, first of all, you can dispense with it; but if you feel like it, you can flatten it and then turn it over and you'll see how it has little tabs on it to reinstall it.<br /><br />Actually , once you get that little perforated plate off there, it's trivially simple.<br /><br />Carry on."
890,2,1,2,"Stunk, hard to believe it is good for us. I bought this thinking common spray paint might be a bad idea. The can warned of the issue of fumes, which in the usual manor, I ignored. I sprayed my microwave, and man did it smell, and really seemed like I should not have been so casual about the warning. So then I thought, if the fumes are so bad, and they lasted for weeks, how good is this crap to be so close to our food, In my imagination, it seems worse than a can of Rustoleum! Who knows, it was fairly expensive for a small can, and it didn't give me a good feeling, but again, who knows?"
891,5,1,1,Awesome appliance I really love this microwave.  The design is modern and appealing and the function is ideal for application.  I am very satisfied with having this product on my kitchen countertop.
892,5,1,1,Good product! I use microwave just to rewarm my food. I barely use it to cook. The product is cheap and good for rewarming my food. I already used it for 2 months and have no problem. I don't know how long it is going to last. The product may also be good for cooking but I don't know since I don't cook with microwave.
893,5,96,111,"Great little microwave We needed a small microwave to fit in our newly refurbished 1995 VW Eurovan camper, and this one is perfect. It fits inside an existing cupboard. I had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use, but not when the door is opened. This one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it's in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen. Some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism. Despite this microwave being a different brand that the two we have at home, the turntable mechanism is the same, and it only fits together in one specific position. When it's properly aligned it pops into place and is very stable."
894,4,0,0,"It fits, it works So many negative reviews on this site. I agonized over getting it, but it fits my space so I did.  It works just fine and I'm happy to recommend it if you're stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave. It is a decent microwave for regular use."
896,5,6,6,"Love my microwave! Easy to use and doesn't take up alot of counter space. Also sits higher so it is easy to clean. A little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food, not cooking a ham or turkey in it."
897,5,2,2,"Looks sleek. This brand was cheaper than some of the other major brands; however, this one was highly rated by Consumer Reports. Got here in  2 days!"
898,4,17,19,Good product for the price We use these in our break rooms where they get conciderably more than use than they would in a home enviroment. They are a great product for the price we seem to get on average 3 years use out of them. The more expensive ones we tried lasted about the same amount of time.
899,4,10,12,"Works Just fine If I had read the reviews before purchasing this unit, I probably would not have ordered  it.  After reading the reviews, I was worried that I had made a mistake.  However, I have had it for several weeks now, and it is working just fine.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because the door is a little hard to open.  But for the money, it works quite well.  I'm pretty satisfied with this microwave."
902,5,0,0,"Purchase of Sharp Microwave Purchased from Amazon and was received within 5 days (exceptional).  Since it was the same model as my old one, installation was very easy with no new holes or brackets to install.  So far it works very well and I consider it, at this point, an exceptional purchase."
903,5,2,3,Works Great We have a GE oven/microwave combo (the microwave has the oven controls on it) and the paint was coming off the microwave.  I was concerned it was dangerous so I considered replacing the entire unit.  Then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try.  My husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new.  Couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit.
904,5,4,4,"Don't forget the Microwave. The appliance fits neatly my new kitchen perfectly, we hardly notice it is even there. The function works with all the setting of a regular machine, it just a lot smaller, the size a large dinner plate. I love it!"
905,4,3,3,"Compact, Attractive, Gets The Job Done Oven came quickly and well packaged and protected.  Gave it a try last night. I'm in the middle of some inside renovation, and used the microwave to have something quick to eat. Things I like about this oven,  is the  pull to open door, and being able to heat food using 15 second increments.  You can also adjust cooking times while the oven is in use. One other feature I really like is that the power cord is not ridiculously long.  You can plug this oven in and not have the cord showing from behind the microwave.<br /><br />This is a very solid oven and am pleased with my  purchase though it is a bit higher than most models.  Curved design of the oven also makes cleaning quicker and easier."
906,5,0,0,"Perfect! We were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room, but still large enough to make popcorn, and other things. This one fit the bill and it works great! We love it!"
907,3,1,2,"Looks and warms great but has a problem with the door closing Overall, the appearance of this item looks great! However, I just installed this and there seems to be a problem with the drawer closing properly. Essentially, when one uses the close button or attempts to close the drawer manually, it closes but then immediately reopens. I found a way around this until a service agent can come to fix it which is to hold it closed so it does not reopen. There is a little trick to it and it has to do with timing of when to hold it shut. I did warm up a biscuit in it and it worked beautifully, otherwise!"
908,1,0,1,"disappointed, baffled Disapointed in the fan suction. Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove, almost like there is a ducting leak, because there is plenty of air blowing."
909,3,1,3,"OK el cheapo microwave It does what I bought it to do: boil water and heat leftovers. As stated in other reviews, it heats VERY unevenly. Since I only plan on having this microwave for a year or a year and a half, I went into this purchase willing to put up with such an inconvenience.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good microwave, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a cheap microwave that will hold you over until you can buy something bigger and better, go ahead."
910,5,0,0,"Glad I bought it . . . This is a good little unit. I wanted something of smaller dimensions so I could put it into my RV. It fit perfectly, and it works just fine. Very attractive and very quiet. It's taken a while to get used to the new controls, but that's just because they're different, not bad. I plan to buy another for a small trailer that I have. In short I would recommend this to anybody."
911,5,0,0,"Genius Design With other microwaves, you lose not only it's own footprint in counter space, but also the clearance in front for the door to open.  With this one, the door opens 3 inches above the counter, plenty of room for other food prep. It tucks way back into the corner, previously wasted space.  It's heavy enough to stay put when pulling the door open, light enough to slide to the side for cleaning underneath.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized the controls, but hey, anytime you get a new appliance, it takes a while to get used to the buttons.  Took me 2 rounds to decide the 30 second button was a great invention.<br /><br />My kids said &#34;Whoa, what's that!!!&#34; the first time they saw it.  I think that's high praise in kidspeak."
912,4,0,4,"Its good, recomende Its not working for what I buy this, but use in my home kitchen. Looks nice. Easy for who not use so much microwave. Want for my husband in Freightliner on road, have hot food"
914,1,1,2,Didnt even get to use it once Received this microwave.  The first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off .  It now has no power at all.  I will be returning this and not purchasing a new one.

924,5,4,5,"I was scared at first It is listed as stainless steel, but a magnet stuck tight to it.  This is not typical of stainless-not this much attraction.  Research through  Google showed some stainless is magnetic.  I knew this, but the attraction seemed too strong.Was this a stainless steel coating over iron-I do not know.<br /><br />The microwave has worked very well for me, I have no complaints.<br />Caution: Some cleaners can pit S.S. Amonia should NEVER be used on stainles!  IF-IF it was a S.S. coating and a PIT GOES to  TO THE IRON!<br /><br />My experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside.  The coating starts to seperate  from the metal shell and fall into your food.  You remove it until it is almost all gone, leaving the exposed metal shell to rust.  This has happened to me several times.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Danby Designer from Amazon."
925,2,2,3,"It works good But I don't like the fact that it doesn't have numbers, I always go over the time I need or it takes too long if I do it manually. It's also too small to fit large plates...."
927,5,0,1,Paint saves a perfectly good microwave She Who Must Be Obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake.  A little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into Her kitchen.  It feels good to go one up on this disposable society.
928,5,95,106,College Kid I bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn't a day that goes by that I regret it!<br /><br />This microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean. It is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back!
930,3,2,3,"good microwave This Microwave is pretty good and very quite. I love the way it looks in the kitchen. However, that being said the reason I am not happy with this item completely is because of the way it was packaged when shipped. They don't box this item right and the corners are all exposed during shipping by the time I got it it was all warped and dented. Luckily it was on the side that you cant see when installed and nothing was damaged except for the optional vent part that came with it. Also, the install directions are very confusing..."
931,3,1,1,"Not worth the expense The light on the clock does not stay lit when micro not in use.  When the door opens and shuts, the liquid in a cup or whatever may spill.  Also when reheating coffee from 7-11 it tips over!"

Popcorn, heating coffee, warming left overs and the like and for me, I think it is also great. It reheats just about anything I have tried to just the right temperature.

940,5,2,2,"Saved Me a Packet My microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave.  I didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and I didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it.  So in a couple of hours, I cleaned the microwave (directions online), covered all surfaces from overspray, and used this paint.  Now I have a new microwave and I keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used.  The rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again.  I am very happy."
942,5,345,374,"Great Space Saver I have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size.  Shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts.  However, I have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave.  A few second for most things.  I don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks, etc.  For my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction.  If you need a smaller sized microwave, I highly recommend this one."
943,5,0,2,Product was Great! Really enjoyed the drawer type microwave and the auto open feature is a plus.<br />Comes with full warranty even though is is a refurbished model.
946,4,9,12,"Nice for the money. I bought this microwave to fit into a cabinet. So the measurments were most important to me. Other than that, it has everything I want in a microwave oven. Full size to fit big plates. The carousel works great. Easy controls. Several one push buttons for 1min, 2min, 3min, even a 30 sec button. Readouts  are very bright and easy to see. The only problem is the cabinet. When I got this via UPS, it was packed inside of a plain brown box. Inside that box was the box that the microwave was shipped in. In that box was a full surround of think styrofoam blocks along with some plastic and paperwork. When I took it out of all the wrapping, the cabinet was loaded with dents and one side was slightly collapsed. I don't know how this could have happened unless it was done before shipping. But, why would they ship something they knew was so beat up? The only reason I can think of is......people buy them to put in cabinets like I did. I paid 99.00. Great working microwave. Terrible cabinet."
947,5,0,0,"My favorite microwave I was going to say despite its size, this is a wonderful microwave, but then I think the small size is the best part!  I bought it for my small kitchen, and it's not only adorable, it's a kick ass machine.  Love it!"

960,4,1,1,"Works Fine Works, great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it"
961,5,2,2,"compact and great Microwave that takes half of the space of the previous, fits in the corner and don't interfere with wi-fi!<br />Putting the magnetron beneath the microwave made it compact."
962,2,4,4,"Broken after 4 months I like the form, fits well in the corner of our counter.  Fairly weak strength but adequate for heating up a bowl of food.  Biggest issue is that it is now DEAD! after only 4 months of use.  Still trying to get Whirlpool to fix or replace it but customer service has not been stellar.  Day 5 after contacting them but still trying to reach the person I need."

967,4,61,71,"Good microwave for small kitchens and as for the price The microwave is really OK as for the price; if you don't need to have a 'fancy', big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes - it's perfect!<br />I tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn - it also works well.<br />CONS: a little bit noisy when it's ending preparation; popcorn button doesn't work well - program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped<br />PROS: easy to use; small; built-in kitchen timer; cheap"
968,5,3,3,Does the trick It microwaves leftovers and it fits in the corner with a relatively small footprint.  That's all I ask from it.  Wish it came with a low profile plug but I figured out a way to make it work.
969,5,2,2,"Nice little unit This microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking.  It's full-plate size, fine for heat-ups and smaller casserole dishes.  Best of all is the way it fits into a corner.  Yes it takes up space, is not &#34;tiny&#34; but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space.  Controls are easy to set.  Haven't had a microwave in years, and somebody suggested this.  I'm happy with it."
973,4,0,0,Microwave Good unit<br />Easy to install as I. Was replacing old unit<br />Color was as expected it to be when opened
974,2,3,5,Damaged The door has a huge dent in it. Makes me suspicious of how &#34;new&#34; the product is or if it is a factory second or something  returned by another purchaser.
975,5,2,2,Excellent for small space This small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles.  It fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave.  It's easy to clean.  I'm so pleased with my decision.
977,4,2,2,nice little microwave Purchased this microwave for my husband's semi truck.  It would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck.  Fought with it for several days until I decided it would work great here at home!!  I love that it takes up so little room on my counter.  It's perfect for the one or two person household!!
980,4,1,1,Compact and Efficient Love this new Microwave; fits perfectly on my small counter and is very efficient for what I need; heating a cup or my heat pad... The only negative I have is that the plastic cover on the bottom front panel is starting to deteriorate already and I've only had it a couple of months... Otherwise love it!
982,5,1,1,"Looks great! This microwave is simple to use, and it works great.  At first I was a little apprehensive about the matt finish on it but once we got it installed, it looks great.  I love it!  My husband and I installed it...we only needed a basic drill, it took a couple of hours but we got it done."
984,5,2,2,Love this microwave! Love this microwave! It heats food & drink up fast. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the compact size! Counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves~so this definitely opens up some counter space. It's so cute too!
986,5,0,1,Touch up Just needed for a touch up<br />But works great!  Will keep<br />On hand if see another chip<br />To be fixed
987,4,5,5,"Just what I wanted This microwave isn't perfect but it's perfect for me. Some folks would think it's a little loud, both while running and the beeper. It takes a little longer to heat than larger units but that's to be expected. Those are minor issues for me. It's just the right size and fits nicely in the dead space of a corner. Has freed up counter top space. It heats frozen food just fine and that's all I use it for. If I were asked what needs improving, I'd like to be able to key in the heating time rather than push the button up and down. And backlighting for the buttons. Overall, it fits my needs."
989,5,4,5,"Very happy My unit arrived quickly and in good order.  Took just a little time for my wife and I to mount this on the wall; the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc.<br /><br />Been working perfectly, can't think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top; small items could fall into this area.  I would agree with them, though in my case there's nothing above that would fall into it."
990,5,4,4,"Fantastic space saver I was looking for!!! Oh my gosh!!! This is fantastic!! It saved sooooo much counter space. We have a family of 3 and it suits us perfectly. I had one of the big stainless microwaves, just took up so much counter space.<br />Only down side is you cannot type in a specific time for something to heat. You press the start button and it's automatic 30 seconds (press twice, 60...and so on) now that it's been a few weeks, I don't really miss the number bad. I'd rather save the space!!"
991,5,7,8,"OMG! This thing is a knockout!! We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line? Outstanding microwave!"
993,5,1,2,Did the trick! Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made!)! There was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? It was there.<br /><br />The whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave. Lots of videos on the web to help you along the way. Be patient and keep track of your screws!
996,5,2,2,great product This is a great product  Fixed my microwave like it was brand new  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave
997,1,0,1,"received dented unit I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit."
998,5,19,21,"Love it This is a great microwave combination convection oven, the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that, but now my wife and I truly love it"
999,4,2,4,super in a small size all the feturers of the big microwaves in a compact size<br />the handle makes it easy to open without spilling food
1000,3,8,10,"Good and bad The price can't be beat, and it has only the features I wanted.  However, it's noisy, and the door is difficult to open.  I practically have to punch the toggle or hold the unit with my left hand, while I push on the switch with my right.  I'm hoping this gets easier over time."
1002,5,3,3,"Best small microwave! We needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space. Most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is. It takes up very little room, plus it fits easily into a corner. It has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate. It's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare, but it is shorter than many standard microwaves. It has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine. We're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity. Some things take longer to cook but not by much.<br />If you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly, this is not the microwave for you. On the other hand, if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy I definitely recommend this one. We love it!"
1004,1,2,2,"Stopped working after 1 week After using the microwave for 1 week, it stopped working.  I just sent it back and waiting for a replacement.  I will give sharp 1 more chance."
1005,5,0,0,"perfect fit We needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet. We struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby. This one is a perfect fit. I was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others, so far it has worked great for our needs. Plus it looks great in the space."
1006,4,2,2,"As others have said... We don't use a microwave all that much and didn't want to invest counter space in one.<br /><br />With a teenager who is now heating things up for himself, it made sense to get one and this small-footprint model seemed to be a good fit.  It handles our largest dinner plate and seems to heat things well.  It is s little taller than it looks in the picture, but it fits our family's needs quite well."
1007,5,1,1,Great Product We needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect.  Nice looking machine and tucks into a corner.  Would recommend to others.
1008,1,8,8,Dead in about a month I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled.  Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell.  It is apparently fried (which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced.  The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive.  Not even a light.<br /><br />I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp.  Very disappointing.  We'll see how the service from Sharp goes...
1009,3,1,2,"A little big..easy to use. Bigger than previous Microwave - larger form factor, had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous Microwave.<br />Easy to use, works well, heats food evenly."
1010,5,2,2,"Nice Microwave w/glass turntable Chosen for it's size, this microwave is pretty perfect for us. We use it for simple warm ups and reheating. It works great.<br /><br />It is surprisingly very heavy. Arrived very well packaged.<br /><br />I love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back."
1012,4,121,133,"fits the space We needed this size and the Danby works.  The controls are a little quirky, you have to put a &#34;0&#34; in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time...  took some getting used to.  The only real design flaw is that, unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open, you have to pull the handle on this one.  And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open.  This can be a pain.  But if you need this size, the cooking is fine."
1013,1,7,9,"Damaged Unit I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon.  Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems. This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer."
1014,4,1,3,"Whirlpool Microwave This microwave will fulfill my needs at this time.  I am well pleased with the wattage of this microwave, this microwave replaced one with much less wattage."
1015,4,5,7,HAPPY Verry good appliance don't have any of the issues i saw posted before i bought it only one thing should warn buyers it is a green appliance so no in microwave light sorry but other than that works like a charm.
1016,4,1,1,"Hello, counter space!!! Okay, it's not the most powerful thing ever, and there are a few things I would change about the design, but this little thing handles all my microwave needs and has freed up a significant amount of precious counter space in my very cramped kitchen."
1018,5,0,0,Sharp Microwave Drawer Oven - Stainless Steel This is an excellent Microwave and very big.  I am so very pleased with this product.  I think it is the favorite of my Grand kids in the kitchen!
1019,5,0,0,"Sharp R-1405 Microwave We picked this microwave primarily for its dimensions (we needed one with a short height). We are very pleased with this model since it is easy to use, works well and is very quiet. It's not loaded with features but has been a pleasure use over the last few months that we've owned it."
1021,4,1,2,"nice microwave the microwave has work very nice, a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook."
1022,4,9,13,Love it I had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged. After the third one was installed it looks great and works great. I got it just before Thanksgiving so I used it as an oven so I then had two ovens which came in very handy.
1023,5,2,3,perfect size after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; I came across this from Whirlpool..It had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is PERFECT!!
1024,4,0,0,Microzilla II This replaces an old Sharp Carousel we use as a second microwave and lasted 14 years. My daughter called it microzilla because you had to shorten cooking times somewhat because it had so much power. This one carries on the tradition.
1025,5,1,2,Purchased for dimensions The unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years. Although none of the holes lined up the Sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop. So far the unit has performed as advertised.
1026,3,1,1,"Good enough It works.  It does seem a bit cheaply made, but you aren't paying top dollar so you should expect that.  The door isn't real solid feeling, so far no problems though.  We mounted this over stove and the fan had low and high and now only has high.  Not sure what happened but it still works.  Be aware that if this microwave gets too hot (sitting over a self clean oven or cooking at high temps) the fan will kick on and won't shut off.  Fine, but we didn't know that at first and thought it was broken.  It's just trying to cool itself off!  Love the 30 second feature.  So many things just need short time to warm up or soften and so just pop it in, press the 30 sec and it goes.  Easy, fast.  Use that all the time."
1027,5,2,2,"Still Functioning & Looking Great I bought this microwave about two years ago, and it still looks and functions great!  Have not had a single issue. :)"
1028,3,1,1,"a bit clunky sounding when shutting, yet works well and seems to be a good value for the price. I guess I just miss the more sleek, less noisy one that broke after 9 years :-)"
1029,4,1,1,"Small and cute, does the job This microwave is very cute (there's no other word to describe it!), and as promised is good for small spaces. It does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves I am used to, and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the + sign to increase time, as opposed to just typing in the number. So far I have had no issues, and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice."
1031,1,3,3,"Missing parts, cannot install until Samsung rectifies One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store....."
1032,5,0,1,microwave paint This is stuff. It really worked very well. It save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well. I highly recommend this product.
1033,2,1,1,"Need to upgrade the shipping method I received and installed the microwave. So far, I am pleased with it.<br /><br />It was damaged in shipping (a dent on the top back edge. This does not affect the installation or operation. I noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping. This needs to be fixed. Better packaging and selection of carrier might help.<br /><br />The hardware (toggle bolts) were cheap and just fell apart when I used them. i had to use other hardware to install the unit.<br /><br />The template is a bit off. I had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit. I measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 3/4 of an inch."
1034,5,8,8,"Perfect microwave! As all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. I now have so much more room on my counter.<br />The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. Worth getting used to for the extra space gained. Plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less."
1035,5,1,1,"Excellent product I researched many microwaves for our needs, and this is the perfect unit. It is my second one, as the first I had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store, it arrived damaged. This one arrived fine, well packaged for the trip. It cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous. It arrived when promised. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
1037,4,0,1,New Spacemaker - Good Had one about 20 yrs. that was losing power.  New one has added features that are helpful - esp. sensor cooking.<br />Price is up there esp. for stainless steel.
1038,5,1,2,best microwave yeayy I love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside !! it has popcorn button as well !!
1039,1,2,4,Two of these blew up - I mean sparks then death. This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.
1042,5,0,0,"Great microwave during the kitchen remodel we decided to install a commercial type exhaust fan and eliminated the typical microwave location about the stove.  This thing is cool, push a button and the drawer opens, drop in your food, push another button and the drawer closes."
1044,5,0,0,"Great purchase, done well! Purchase was a good one.  Love the design of the microwave, and so far it meets all my needs.  Being short, the drawer is much more comfortable for me.  The process of ordering and receiving from Amazon was simple, efficient and has been one of the best purchases I've made in the whole kitchen reno project. Thanks Amazon."
1046,5,1,1,Did what it was supposed to do Did the job. Great coverage. Made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new. Very satisfied.  Would purchase again
1047,5,0,0,"Holding Up So Far So far, so good.  I have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  If I start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), I'll post an update.  We use this appliance several times a day, everyday."
1049,2,1,4,"Goodbye Whirlpool The beep is too loud, and the door rattles. Fixed the door rattle by lifting up the back with a folded 3 by 5 card. Good microwave oven for the near deaf. And the digital display is too bright in my studio apartment; I wanted a microwave oven, not a nightlight."
1050,1,2,2,"BAD, BAD, BAD! After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!"
1052,4,2,2,"Door does not always close properly Microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected.  Keep in mind that we do not cook in it... we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers.  We like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the + button that adds 5 seconds at a time.  The only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut.  We need to push it up a little to get it to close.  Other than that, it was a great purchase for us"
1055,5,1,1,"Great price, well packaged. This Kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year. Since tubes are now made in far east, instead of by Raytheon, quality as dropped, I now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it. It was nice to find a tube with diode (which has never failed) for such a great price."
1056,5,2,2,Great purchase This saved us from needing to buy a new microwave/ oven combo. Easy to use.  We used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up.
1057,5,2,2,Great microwave paint. Very high quality product. This paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish.
1058,2,9,9,"2 defects in less than a month.  Too hot to touch when cooking on stovetop Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs Caf¨¦ Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave."
1059,5,1,2,"Great microwave for limited space I needed a small, compact microwave. This is perfect if you have limited counter space. The depth is good. It will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave. This is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side. The control buttons are simple but intuitive."
1060,5,0,0,Very nice parts. I ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days.<br />My turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave.<br />I'm very easy removed old engine and put new one.<br />Quality product and parts was new.<br />Highly recommended this seller.
1062,1,1,7,"Did not work at all- Twice. I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product)."
1063,5,1,1,"Great little unit Love this little microwave! It is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use."
1064,1,3,4,none functioning microwave Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.
1067,5,0,0,"DOES THE JOB DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.

1071,5,4,4,awesome deal fits perfect and works great never thought I would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look
1076,4,1,2,Good microwave but a little expensive for what you get This is a good microwave that fits well in the corner of the kitchen. It fits a full size dinner plate.
1079,5,0,0,Works well bad reviews might have been a bad batch or quality control issue The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. This microwave has worked great for us. Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. I really like the one touch timer feature. It seems to be well built. Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013. I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.
1080,4,1,1,only had a short time only one I could find to fit in space.  couldn't use all the others because once installed was unable to open door because it is next to an extended wall.  I hunted all  over for a microwave that the door hinge was about an inch from side.
1083,5,0,0,Best purchase this year! This microwave works well and is efficient. It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. Would not hesitate to purchase again.
1084,2,3,10,"Not compact I got this because it was touted as a mini-microwave. Of course, I am capable of reading the dimensions, which I did, but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave. It simply won't work with my limited counter-space. I don't know how well it works, because after trying it in various spots, I put it right back in the box. BTW, it is $30 to send back, so make sure you want it before you order."
1085,3,7,9,"Door seems not very stable ;( I like this microwave, EXCEPT the door is NOT always close right.. as you close it, it's almost as if it was installed a bit lower than it needs to be to close securely. The family is ALWAYS complaining about it:(  Also, for the size of this thing, I thought it would be a tiny bit taller INSIDE. Our freezer makes ice-cream VERY HARD so we 'nuke' it for maybe a minute to get it softer before serving- the round ice-cream container cannot fit upright in it.  Some cups do not fit either.<br /><br />The PLUS side of this tho, is that it DOES fit snugly into a corner! THAT is the only thing that sells it, in my opinion. I have NO IDEA WHY, it is so big & bulky for the size it actually IS, on the inside!? There is a solid 5&#34; of 'bulk' at the bottom, another 3&#34; at the top and about 6 & 3/4&#34; of height INSIDE.... and that does NOT include the plate & roller.... so you TRULY ONLY HAVE a microwave that is 5 & 3/4 INCHES tall inside!! ... The PLATE within, is an 11&#34; plate, but it is very close to the edge. ALSO, the bottom roller that holds the plate in place- is in TWO PARTS, rather than ONE. If this roller gets off the other piece... it makes a rattling noise & makes you think there is something very wrong with it.<br /><br />We only use a microwave for warming things, reheating pizza, a cup of coffee etc., and this does that job very well, however, for $150, I would have absolutely RETURNED IT- had I not lived on an island in Alaska, where the shipping would have KILLED  me :("
1086,5,2,2,Perfect size for small space. This little giant is great for small spaces. It is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves. I am very happy with purchase.
1090,2,1,2,"Looks great but longevity poor This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected. Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died, an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product. I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem, if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call, but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product."
1092,5,1,2,"Worked 100% This kit is just what I needed.  My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  Now it works like new again.<br /><br />***There are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*"

1101,3,2,2,Came damaged Box was not crushed but top venting cover was dented and cracked.  I used the old one from the same model that needed to be replaced as to avoid all of the return BS.
1102,2,6,7,"TURNTABLE DOES NOT WORK While I love the shape of the microwave (it does fit perfectly in a corner), the turntable is defective and does not turn.  Upon removing the packaging, I immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok, walked off a minute and when I returned the water was very hot.  I thought eveyrthing was ok, so I threw the packaging away.  A few days later, I put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that's when I noticed the turntable was not turning!  I opened the door, checked the wheels it revolves on, replaced the glass, gave the glass a little turn and still nothing.  I tried even placing things of different weights on it, sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop.  So buyers beware, I would not purchase this item."
1103,5,1,1,Corner microwave This met our requirements for a space saving microwave.  We would recommend it to any one with limited counter space.
1104,1,0,0,Bad choice. It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.
1105,4,2,2,Good simple microwave It is a basic microwave and so far working very well.<br />It fit perfect over our oven range.<br />My husband and his friend's help needed for taking old one out and setting this microwave up.<br />Door feels very light (we are used to the metal one) so we get gentle on it.
1107,4,1,1,"Great style and size but it is a little deep for where I have it. Beautiful and stylish. Easy to use, with sensitive touch screen."
1109,5,0,0,I love it When ordering cabinet for microwave I had no clue that Sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly.  It looks so great and works beautifully.
1110,1,0,0,"Door opening button broke; GE won't fix I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything."
1111,5,0,1,Great Microwave works and looks FANTASTIC!!!!!! We got it the same day our cabinets were being installed. We were worried about it not working since this was our first on-line purchase of such a high priced item. Let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed FANTASTIC!!!! it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens. We installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop. great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop. No more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out. This is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen.
1112,5,3,3,"More powerful than expected Bought this for a small kitchen, it fits nicely in the corner and works great. Seems to be well-made. Although it is lower wattage, I have not had to significantly increase the cooking time, and I can fit a plate or even cook/reheat in a round 2qt dish. The beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints."
1115,4,2,3,"It is what is... This product fits into a small corner counter space that I have, and it &#34;looks&#34; nice...but truth be told, I could have saved money and bought a small rectangular MW and put it on the same counter, although it wouldn't have looked quite as nice as this one does."
1117,5,32,32,Great Product The ceiling of my microwave was a disaster. Paint was peeling all over it. This product did the trick. Make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one.
1122,5,1,1,Perfect for my RV. Bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my RV.  I had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me.  The unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well.<br /><br />Great item at a great price.  Enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks.
1123,5,0,0,"Kind of hard to LOVE a microwave, but... I have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5-6 weeks. I researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one. The availability and price here on Amazon beat my local big box stores and chains. Installation appeared easy for my contractors. There are options to allow venting outside, either behind or above the microwave (not so clear from product description) but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage (not compatible with local code).<br /><br />The bells and whistles are amazing, with our kids ready to show us how it works, right after we stop the clock blinking on our VCR."

I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had.  I ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  Then sanded smooth.  Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. Masked off area to be painted.  Ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  I applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!"

I wonder if the tech will really getting it to work correctly. Waiting now for parts to fix the oven portion of the unit.

Anyway here I am one full month after purchasing the oven and can't use it.

It fits neatly into a corner of my countertop, in no way dominates the area, and functions way beyond what I expected.  If you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  Highly recommended."
1134,1,4,7,"UPS Strikes Again After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.

1139,4,2,3,"good concept This is a great design concept.  It gives you more counter space.  I was worried about it making soup spill with jerky loading, but I haven't found that to be a problem.<br />The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the interface is a bit clumsy.  For pretty  much everything, it requires too many key strokes to get it doing what you want. It's like the old days of operating a VCR. way too complicated. It's like you have to keep the manual out on the counter if you want to do anything other than run if for 1, 2 or 3 minutes.  defrosting = difficult .. timer = difficult... resetting the clock = difficult<br />In summary: as long as your key objective is to get the microwave off of the counter, and you only plan on using it to reheat things at max heat, then you will love it."

1148,4,7,8,"Good convection/microwave functionality We used the Dacor labelled version of this aplliance for 10 years before it gave out. Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor, at half the price. So we ordered this one, but returned it immediately because it  had dents, so obviously had been dropped, and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage. Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return. I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system (vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product), a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying. The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one, but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is. 850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years.  Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long? And the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will.<br />Anyway I think this is a pretty good product, particularly if you use the convection function a lot. One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside, remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line. Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion. The exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease, causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron. Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean. If we had done those things our old Dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer. We considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease."

Door is flimsy and bends easily so it requires a careful and firm slam to shut properly or the latch doesn't catch and it won't operate.  Same with closing after use, or light won't go out.  For the wear and tear, I imagine that the latch is what is going to finally break first.  This is the first truly disappointing major brand appliance that I have bought, and it was not the low end model.  We got GE Profile to match our other kitchen appliances. We will be needing a new dishwasher soon. This is enough to make us change brands."

We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one.<br /><br />Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping (fair enough), but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee.<br /><br />This is absurd. Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box- we simply opened the top, and then re-closed it. 30% seems like usury to me. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee. I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30%... what are they doing, just trashing returns?<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again, I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE, and reward these unfair business practices.<br /><br />We own a business, and we expect to be treated as consumers, the same way we treat our customers.. that simply isn't happening here."

It defrosts without cooking, won't burn popcorn, can soften butter without melting, and of course looks amazing. Its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install.  If I had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages.  Still worth it and would still recommend it."
1172,5,116,122,"Very, very happy with this. I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since. I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath."
1176,3,0,0,"Replaced Previous Version We ordered this to replace the previous version. Style is slightly different. It does not seem as sturdy as the last one and it didn't last as long we would have expected a semi-premium appliance line to last. We use it as built in, which was fine for the first one, but this door is not conducive to built in configurations. The new black trim is okay. So far it works fine."
1178,5,7,8,More than I expected Many more features than advertised. Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.
1179,5,0,0,"Really great Great little microwave. It's the perfect size. It's a little underpowered, so a add 30 secs to most cooking times.<br />Small footprint and looks great in the kitchen."
1180,5,5,5,"Perfect Fit I got this to save counterspace and the fact I only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn.  It performs these functions perfectly.  It may not have the most power but if another 30-60 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off, you have bigger problems than this microwave."
1181,5,1,1,"Best Microwave that I've owned I needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top, and I couldn't find anything smaller than a 0.7 Cu. Ft. in any store.  Since this one had so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter, but it is also the best microwave I've ever owned.  It fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size, and it heats up very quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen."
1188,5,1,1,"Small, but so great. This little microwave fits into the corner.  We have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience.  If you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker, so keep that in mind when deciding."
1189,5,4,4,"Awesome microwave! This is perfect for one plate! It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! I got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes."
1191,2,5,7,"Choose Panasonic instead Door doesn't always close right and although it is practically new, it sounds like it is dying.  Would not purchase again!"
1193,3,3,3,"4/2016 update  - 3 yr lifespan.   nice small microwave I loved this microwave's size and shape but in the last month (4/2016) I had two sparking incidents, luckily I was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly.  I just threw it out. Today I was looking online to see when I bought it (April 2013) and if anyone else had reported similar issues.   I see that there are similar reviews so don't think Ill buy another even tho I like the size and shape.   UPDATED 4/2016  it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap, this looks nice and works great, a keeper"
1195,1,28,29,"Worked for 1 month I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product."
1196,4,0,0,Works as promised Same model that we had before with some cosmetic changes.  The old one died after 6 years.  Reviews placed it at over $160 for repair.  Bought the old one because it fits on shelf over the stove.  Bought the new one for the same reason.  Hope we get at least 6 years out of it.
1197,4,0,1,"Pretty good for a little guy! The only thing I would chande is the push handle.  Sometimes it diesn't work the first time and it feels like it sticks.  Otherwise, a good product and good value."
1198,4,6,8,"Microwave is great but..... I found it cheaper at Lowe's by $150.00. Too late now, it's too cumbersome to return.<br />It pays to shop around."
1200,5,1,1,I luv this microwave This is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen. The domed shape works great on my smaller counter top. Would recommend it!
1201,3,28,30,Not Pleased First time around - I'll try a second time My wife wanted a smaller microwave for the counter top.  This was perfect --- at least for 28 days.<br /><br />On the 28th day - all the controls appeared to work but the unit no longer heated.<br /><br />Amazon's return policy was to issue a refund - I wanted it fixed so I contacted Whirlpool directly.  They stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that I would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced.<br /><br />It's now one week later - no response from Whirlpool and I can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago.<br /><br />I decided to contact Amazon about the issue.  Amazon is sending me a return label and issuing a refund.  (I should have done THIS in the first place and never bothered with Whirlpool).<br /><br />I just ordered my SECOND unit from Amazon --- I'm hoping this one will last longer than 28 days.<br /><br />I would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed --- now only 3.  If the second one fails - I'll drop it to 1 or zero stars.<br /><br />I give Amazon 5 stars for service on this item.<br /><br />Joe
1203,5,4,5,"Great product! Love that it is off the counter, large, and works well.  I originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems.  An electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it, and without question, we bought the same one."
1206,5,0,0,"Just what I needed! A similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non-adjustable shelve/frame above the counter top.  Searched websites and found what I wanted.  then searched Amazon and found one with the best price (@ Abe's of Maine)!  Quick delivery and the packaging/crating was extraordinary.  Would buy product again, and would buy from Abe's of Maine again!"
1207,5,11,12,"Great for small spaces I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.  It heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it.  Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well."
1208,5,1,1,what we needed I needed a little oven that fit in the corner.  For size and convenience it works well.  I have found that I need to leave what ever I am cooking in the oven a little bit longer.  But it works well and no complaints about operation.
1209,5,0,0,"great product Fits perfectly in our countertop CORNER.  Fits in the &#34;dead space&#34; there.<br />It's on the small side, but it is perfect for our needs."
1210,5,6,6,"spacesaver I have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave. I was looking for a space saver microwave, and I found it. It is large enough to handle anything my old microwave could do like day to day tasks of reheating, baking potatoes, and other small food items."
1211,5,4,4,"Just what a microwave should be... Small! Exactly what I wanted! It's the perfect fit. Works just fine... Bye bye bulky hand me down... I'm handing you down, lol"
1213,5,3,11,Unit is Top of the line Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.I would recommend this item.
1214,5,4,4,"I love the microwave It met all my needs regarding space, looks like a TV, works well and you don't need a college degree to operate. Very pleased with this products. Little pricey but worth it."
1215,3,1,1,Not the specified dimensions This Spacemaker microwave is 3/4&#34; deeper than in the specifications. This is the difference between fitting and not fitting in a 12&#34; deep cabinet.
1216,5,54,55,"works great - easy to use. I had a rust spot inside my microwave oven.  Sanded it down, put on two coats of paint, fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back."
1217,5,1,1,"excellent I like this microwave, it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen, but it is powerful. It is a good combination of quality and good design. Expensive but worth it"
1224,5,1,1,"Great microwave, easy to install and a space saver! Looks great, works great. Took less than an hour to install. Was a little overwhelmed with instructions, but was easier to install than originally thought. Looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
1225,5,3,3,"It's a space saver It's rather small on the outside, and just big enough on the inside.  Everyone who comes over thinks it's a TV."
1228,5,0,3,"Good Quality Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that."
1229,5,8,8,"Love this - Perfect for a small kitchen From the moment I took it out of the box, it looked beautiful, fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great! I put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass. I did not want my old LARGE white microwave oven taking up one entire wall. I don't use the microwave that much, so this is perfect.  It's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn AND you want style and beauty - this is it!"
1230,3,28,35,"Decent This microwave is fine. It is not great. It takes three and a half minutes to warm up a cup of coffee, but since that is its only function on our counter it is doing its job, just slower than some of the more powerful ones. Its size is definitely a plus and fits in a wee corner. Its not having more programable numbers is annoying as one has to hold the button as the time counts up incrementally, but for a cup warmer it will do."
1231,5,1,1,"Well built product I purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model ($200+) from Williams-Sonomo and this Whirlpool is a much better machine. The build quality is excellent and the veritcal-ness of it saves space on the counter. Had to return the Williams-Sonoma model.  The Whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls.<br />At first, I missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad. However,, after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds. Super product that I would buy again and it looks cool."
1234,5,2,2,Amazing! We love this microwave. It looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was. Our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything (including our largest dinner plates). Heating will require an additional 20-30 seconds but definitely worth the wait!!! Can't say enough about how cool it looks!
1236,4,0,0,"Glad GE makes this size microwave Like other reviewers, I had to purchase this particular GE Spacemaker microwave because it was the only larger one that fit into the existing built-in cabinet in our kitchen.  Other manufacturers are missing the boat if they think everyone wants or needs a huge countertop or above-the-range microwave, or a teensy weensy underpowered microwave. There was no need for the industry to completely change size standards for countertop models.<br /><br />That said, I've only had this microwave a few weeks; so far so good.  I like its features and performance.  It's a bit smaller inside than our previous full size GE microwave.  The previous GE fit perfectly in our microwave cabinet, but its magnetron went out in a scary way after about 6 years of use.<br /><br />So far, only drawback to new microwave is that the instructions say to keep the front of the microwave 3 inches back from edge of countertop so it won't tip over when the door is open.  Not enough space to do that in our built-in microwave cabinet, so have to be careful not to inadvertently put weight on the open door (with my hand), or the whole appliance starts to tip forward.  Don't recollect seeing that information in the description of this product on Amazon, so please be aware."
1239,5,2,2,"Samsung microwave I like the looks, the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel. We have multiple Samsung products. All exceed our expectations of their products<br />There are NO other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons"
1240,5,1,1,"Bargain at the price. Had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years - 2 GE and 3 Samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house, vacation condo, and GF's house. Bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5. Hope to have the same luck with this one."
1241,5,3,3,"Great oven/micro Easy to install, user friendly instructions.  Came in good condition.  Manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  Cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  Really good product."
1243,4,0,0,"We Like This Product. This is a good product. It replaced our previous Profile Spacemaker II model which lasted about ten years.  We're not exotic microwave users and choose the Reheat feature 99% of the time.  The new model works well, although my wife thinks our previous model had a hotter reheat temperature because we more frequently have to press the reheat button a second time with the new model.  We also find the location of the Clear/Off button confusing and sometimes fumble around looking for it.  It should have been placed in an easier to find location, like on the top or bottom corner.  We like the turntable which our previous model didn't have and think it helps heat the food more uniformly.  Overall, we're pleased with this product."
1245,5,2,4,"Love this microwave Love this microwave. Product was Easy to install, and easier to operate. The first one we ordered came damaged. The process to return item was a piece of cake. The second one came (from a different company) and was packaged much much better. We used to have our microwave sitting on the counter. We remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave. We will NEVER go back to any other microwave. Well worth the price..<br />Love, Love , Love this product"
1247,5,8,10,"Good buy, good value This was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel.It is quite roomy. I particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features."
1248,3,3,3,"Updated Sharp over the range microwave Fits perfectly in previous Sharp model space.  Heating seems the same as the previous model although this one states 850 watts and the old one said 1100 watts.  Exhaust does not work as well as the other model.  Fan seems to work same on low and high speed, no difference in sound or intensity of fan sound.  One would think the low would seem quieter."
1250,2,4,4,"Only o.k. We needed a small microwave for a small space, and this fits perfectly ... but:  very low power (takes a long time); not tall enough for many things (have to transfer contents to shorter vessels); extremely loud beeping that can't be turned off."
1253,3,7,7,"Replaced the same model bought 6 years ago Bought this model to replace the one bought thru Amazon 6 years ago. It just died abruptly, thought it was a fuse but if there was one couldn't locate it. Buying the same model made installation a snap. Just hope this one lasts longer"
1254,5,0,0,Just what we wanted to replace our failed unit of 23 yrs! Install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit. Only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good.
1255,5,1,1,Best Ever this is the best Microwave I have ever had.  Love the size and the program buttons.are so nice.<br /><br />I use the Bake Potato button all the time.
1256,4,6,6,"Good Choice Works as advertised. Easy to follow installation instructions and cooks great. Of course, the holes from my old 'Ewave' did not line up with this model."
1257,5,0,0,Perfect replacement for a 30 inch. Thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find. But that was the only thing I could use in the cabinetry in our Winnebago RV. It's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too. We like it's added features oer the older unit we had. It decided to only run on high.
1259,2,1,4,"Does not perform like it should for this price. This microwave does not heat as quickly or as hot as we would like.  It has some great features, but its performance is just not up to par for the price."
1260,4,2,3,Great for the price I spent hundreds more for another &#34;Name&#34; brand and this one is as good.  Cant beat this for the price I paid
1262,4,0,0,"I like it I like the look, the ease of cleaning, and the fact that it does everything I need a microwave to do without taking up much countertop space.  The only drawback is that the interior is so small I sometimes &#34;bump&#34; coffee cups trying to put them in for re-heating, spilling liquid that drips straight down to the control panel.  After having a full size microwave, this one takes some getting adjusting on my part!  I gave it 4 stars because I can't heat pancake syrup in it, the bottles are too tall.  All other things I use it for, such as making popcorn, melting butter, reheating left-overs, etc., are just fine."
1266,5,2,2,"Great As described by Phil, it is very easy to install.  A tip, as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor, put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit.  After you install the new motor, flip the door you cut out over, and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up.  Use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt, as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again."
1268,5,0,0,Planning ahead I currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space I have.  Bought this one again as a spare.  Just in case... and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time.  Very happy with this 800W model.  Does my jobs.<br />  It is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house.  Too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box.
1273,4,6,8,"works well, not liking the push button door release Had 6 months.  It works fine as a microwave, but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want. Window is hard to see the food through, and it always fogs up making it even harder. I like the favorites program, but they should build in an automatic delay between stages. This is because if you program 1 min at high, and 1 min at 50%, you actually get about 1:15 straight high. A third stage would also be nice.  I don't like the push button door latch.  It takes a lot of effort, and if it gets dirty, is hard to clean because it pushes in 1/4 inch without any effort, making wiping it hard. It should have s simple handle."
1274,4,1,1,"Perfect for a craft room I expected this microwave oven to be smaller than it is. I was hoping for a small microwave to go in the craft room for my wife because she spends a lot of time in there and her coffee often goes cold, and instead of having to get up and leave her work, she can reach over and reheat her coffee. I didn't want something that takes up a lot of space. Well, this is about as small as I've seen, but I thought there were smaller ones. We don't have a lot of extra space so we bought this one. It works fine, I personally don't like the bright blue LED clock on the front but my wife doesn't mind. It does what it's supposed to."
1275,3,1,2,It's okay... I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great. I only use for re-heating or defrosting so it is fine for that. Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it...so I use smaller plates for re-heating. I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. It DOES have it's own popcorn button...:)
1276,5,0,0,"GREAT PRICE The Motor fit perfect, works great, price was excellent.<br />Was much cheaper than new microwave A A A A plus"
1277,1,0,0,pem31 microwave All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
1279,4,4,5,"Great microwave Plus - I've had this microwave installed for about 4 months now and I really like it.  It cooks evenly and in a predictable way...much better than the traditional turntable models.  The coolness factor is high and its easy for the kids to use.  I love how it fits in with my new kitchen.<br />Minus -  it's pricey for a microwave.  Considering, the price I expected it to have a few more quick features, like a 30 second reheat button (it will do 1 min).  The open/close mechanism is noisy and closes with a &#34;clunk&#34; .  The special cooking features are complicated to program so I have yet to use them.<br />Summary - It was worth the splurge."
1282,3,3,8,"too early to rate the microwave. It is installed, it heats/cooks still after 4 days.  wife is disappointed in appearance, but it looks ok to me."
1283,5,1,1,"Great Microwave. I bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that I bought the same one for my sister. I like it very much. Its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. I recommend it very highly."
1284,1,5,6,"Problems have started Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me."
1285,4,6,7,"works great VERY smelly!!!<br />Be sure to scrape all rust out with steel wool, paint scraper, whatever it takes. The directions were minimal...I googled for more information."
1288,5,0,0,"Great Microwave. A very compact, beautiful and sleek microwave.  Saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate."
1289,4,0,3,Was Great what they showed is what we got This was to replace a bad microwave in one of our condo's kitchen - it fit perfectly and looks good. Thank You
1290,4,3,4,"Better than I expected If you're looking for a space saver, this is the microwave for you.  If fits so well in the corner of the counter top and I have twice the space I had when my old bulky clunker was still on the counter.  I haven't found a plate yet that doesn't fit in the microwave and only one conatiner was too tall to fit, but even that wasn't critical...just used another container.  The power is suffiecient for warming and cooking most foods.  I do wish it had a few more watts; around 1000 would be perfect.  Over all the compromise in power is well worth the additional space.  Controls are very simple although, I do wish I could increase the time in more than 30 second increments.<br /><br />Service was terrific!  The first unit arrived damaged by the shipper.  Replacement was fast and problem free."
1291,2,1,5,"Just Installed it in a new kitchen Looks great. But you have to press Open and Close buttons to open and close drawer. Very delicate product. It is uncomfortable, unpractical to press these buttons everytime. I am sure they will go bad very soon. I will not suggest anybody to purchase this product"
1293,5,4,4,"Tiny Perfection Fits a cup of coffee, dinner plate and popcorn. What else do you need? Fits perfect in my cabinet out of site!"
1294,5,2,2,"Sharp Microwave Turntable Motor RMOTDA252WRZZ This product fit and worked as expected. For anyone wondering about how to install, there is a pattern of holes drilled in the bottom of the microwave around the turntable motor. To get to the motor, gently cut the metal between the holes to create a little door. Open the door, remove 2 screws then the motor, unplug old motor, plug in new one, drop new motor into hole, put 2 screws back. You're probably supposed to throw the &#34;door&#34; away but I bent mine back in there. Flip microwave over and plug it in, put turntable spindle back on and try it out. I recommend doing this out of sight of your spousal unit, and then take about 30 minutes to goof off. Then return microwave to spousal unit telling them what an arduous task it was but how you figured it out and saved the family $100.00. Should be good for at least a hug or a kiss or WHATEVER..."
1295,5,1,1,Exactly what I needed This microwave works well. I wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders. It does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter. I am very pleased.
1296,4,2,2,Really looks great Looks and works great so far... the vent is really nice and powerful too... a bit loud when you set it at the highest but sure does work
1298,1,9,12,Whirlpool Wouldn't work.  Have to return it.  The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door.<br />There is no problem.
1299,1,7,7,"Didn't work Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on."
1300,4,6,6,"The best available When our old Sharp &#34;over the range&#34; started to die (14 years of service and the display had become very dim and door starting to crack with quite large chips falling off we decided it had to be replaced). Finding an over range (gas) with convection and a good extractor fan proved difficult and so we decided on this Sharp product. At 71 lbs and with different mounting points from it's predecessor it was a difficult installation task - could not have been done by one person on their own.<br />Once in place however it is the greatest ! It is better designed than the one before with 2 extractor inlets placed to handle the heat from the gas range very well , a large ceramic turntable that is easy to clean PLUS it can be selected to &#34;not rotate&#34; which permits bigger dishes to be used as needed.<br /><br />Best of all it has a &#34;keep warm&#34; feature that allows warming serving plates as well as keeping unserved food ready  for &#34;seconds&#34; without the whole reheat cycle.<br /><br />Great product - would have given 5 stars but for the physical difficulty of installation ( in fairness that would have probably been much the same for any brand)"
1301,1,9,9,Bad Product Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.
1302,5,1,2,"New microwave We love this new appliance.  Just a few days before Thanksgiving our old one died.  I purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches.  Returned that one and went online and found this one at almost $100.00 less than what my local dealer could get it for me.  He agreed that I should order thru Amazon and not only did I receive it in less than a week, it fit, looks great and works perfectly!"
1303,5,1,2,"Perfect size for table top microwave Simple to use, spacious, and compact. :)  Been looking for a microwave like this for a while.  The only drawback is it looks a bit like a old TV on the kitchen counter."
1305,5,5,6,Did the job The microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable. I sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint. I did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well. There's a spot that looks like I didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re-do it. It's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month.
1306,3,0,0,Difficult to Open The push latch for the door is very tricky.  Sometimes it opens the door at once.  Mostly it takes repeated efforts.
1307,3,1,2,"NO CHOICE IN PURCHASING, ADEQUATE PRODUCT This is the only microwave made that fits into my pre-constructed custom cabinet space. My first one lasted 8 years.  When it wouldn't turn off, I ordered a new one.  The first one sent to me would not turn on.  Seems like something was wrong with the key pad. GE's fault,not the distributor or Amazon.  Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged /sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly.  I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent."
1309,5,26,31,"Tiny treasure I live in a small house (400 sf) so I don't have much room for anything. This may be too soon for a review (as I just received the microwave y'day) but so far it's just perfect. I love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side, as my microwave cubby is only 16.5 inches wide. I like the style and the easy setup, as well. It's perfect for an apartment, dorm room, or office kitchen.<br /><br />One thing to note - on the inside left wall (if you're facing the microwave), there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent. There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification. Long story short - don't remove the panel, it's supposed to be there.<br /><br />Other than that momentary confusion, I'm really happy with this product."
1313,5,2,2,"Great Item Item was what was advertised, in condition advertised and delivered on time. That's all you can ask of a supplier. You must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint. Takes a lot of sanding and preparing, but the result of spraying even coats is great."
1314,5,3,3,Very nice design I bought this microwave almost a year ago. Love it. Quality is good enough ( I do not use it too often). I really in love with the design.
1315,5,1,1,"Nice! This is a really nice little microwave!  Just what I was looking for.  No complaints.  It was shipped quickly by the supplier, too.  The controls are simple and elegant, and the surfaces are easy to clean.  I would buy it again."
1316,5,3,3,Fast shipment! So far so good. Replaced a Samsung and the existing bracket worked. Much quieter than the one replaced. My wife loves the<br />melt/soften function.
1319,4,1,9,"Good Microwave I have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions, but so far it seems like a good machine."
1322,5,0,0,I ordered these motors to power a miniature barber pole project they work great. Motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good.
1325,1,8,27,Mr. Johnny Warren This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products
1326,5,3,3,"Affordable Quality This is the second Sharp R-1405, Over the Range Microwave I have owned. The first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service. So I was thrilled when I found the same model still being produced. I snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90% of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove. Not only that..The price was about $200 or $300 less than comparable over the range microwaves. An excellent product that gets the job done!!...I highly recommend it!"
1330,5,4,4,"Sharp Microwave Turntable For some strange reason, my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half.  I didn't have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an Amazon vendor.  The order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again.  We are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product."
1332,5,1,1,"Perfect!!! When the turntable on my Sharp microwave stopped turning, I went on line to find a substitute.  Some years ago I had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave.  Simple device.  Works by winding it up, much like an old fashioned alarm clock.<br /><br />After Googling turntable, I came upon this little motor and thought &#34;Why not?&#34;, I can do this.  I know nothing about electronics, so I realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix, I might destroy it, but it wasn't working anyway so I decided to gamble and order the part.<br /><br />I very carefully opened up the microwave (after disconnecting it from the power) and located the motor that turned the turntable.  It was simple (fairly intuitive) to remove and replace, and for a very small amount of money, I fixed the microwave.  I've had this microwave for seven plus years and now I expect to get another seven, very possibly more.<br /><br />Overall...  one of my best buys on Amazon."
1333,1,1,5,different photo in ad Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step. The actually ad is different than the actual product.
1335,5,2,3,"Samsung Microwave Very attractive and functional microwave, that was easy to install as a replacement for a GE microwave that no longer worked."
1338,5,15,17,"Big, Well Built Needed a new stainless steel microwave. Works well, nice and big. It is only stainless on the front, black everywhere else. Works well so far..."
1339,5,1,2,"GE Profile Microwave This is an excellent product. It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. Its not only nice looking, but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best. The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor."
1341,4,13,14,met my expectations Used this microwave as a built-in. I had a specific width opening in some shelving and wanted the most cu ft and features in this width. Only been using it for a couple weeks however it has met my expectations. The body of this unit is black so if you are looking for an all stainless for countertop use this would not be the one.
1343,1,5,6,"This microwave SUCKS!!!!! This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0."
1344,5,1,1,"My Favorite Microwave This is the third model of this microwave I have bought.  Since I do a lot of cooking with my microwave, I enjoy all the features this one has:  particularly, the &#34;baked potato&#34; and &#34;sensor reheat&#34; functions.  Not only was I overjoyed to find the exact model, I saved over $70 on my replacement!  I was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order!"
1346,2,0,0,"Not like they used to make I purchased this product because our last Spacesaver finally bit the dust after almost 20 years.  Not the same quality product as previously produced. Door sticks , popcorn button doesn't always spin turntable as indicated in manual."
1349,5,15,16,"750 watts and beautiful! This Whirlpool WMC2005YW 0.5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had. We sold our house, where we had a built-in micro, and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small Haier. The only thing good about the Haier was,  it was small, so when it blew out we had to go small again. I totally counted on the reviews for this micro and, thank you everybody, you are so right! I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. The best part is that it really works well. We feared making popcorn, which the Haier never, and I mean never, did well. Always burnt no matter what we tried. This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. There is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. We have never used the auto buttons. I would buy this again in a minute."
1350,5,2,2,fits well in small spaces fits well on countertop in small space. Works very well warming and re-heating. Works better that other microwave that was much bigger.
1351,5,18,20,"Read this!!!!! Then install !!!! Everything is great!!! Just a warning!!!! Double check the template used for the upper cabinet. Actually check it against the unit. In my case I replaced an older Maytag, so I had two existing holes in my cabinet. Then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up!!!!!! I superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up!!! So I did not make a mistake!!!! The Template was off. No real big deal but now I have six holes.<br /><br />Double check the holes!!! Unit is great!! Previous unit did not vent out of the house. This one I installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor. This Microwave gives you three options,Vent back,vent from the top or recirculate. I do not reccomend recirculating!!!! If you can vent this unit or any unit always vent!!!! I had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues, like wires that I had to reroute etc but I knew that when it was over I would be smiling and I am!!!! For the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the VENT is the Greatest!!!!!"
1352,4,0,0,oven I am very satified with this microwave although I was surprised when I saw two small dents on the door.  This of course does not in anyway hamper the workings. I would recommend this product for its efficiency.
1353,3,14,19,"Worried how long it will hold up. I needed a small microwave for my small kitchen and this one fits the bill. (Why aren't there more small appliances out there? Oh right, we live in the U.S., where bigger is supposedly better).<br /><br />Anyway, this microwave has performed fine so far (powerful enough for reheating leftovers in a timely manner). It doesn't heat very evenly, but in my experience, most microwaves don't. If it's soup, no problem, just stir. If it's a frozen burrito, the ends will be bubbling while the middle is still frozen. Annoying.<br /><br />However, the biggest complaint after having this microwave for just one month is that there is a thin layer of plastic over the control buttons and it is already scratched and peeling off in some places! Makes me concerned about the overall quality of this thing."
1355,5,3,3,"Perfect for a small space! My old microwave (dating back to the mid-90s) finally bit the dust.  I was worried that I wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it, but this one fits the bill.  It is small, but big enough for the needs of our 3-person household.  I find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves, and this one offers about the same height as a regular one.  It's not as powerful as some of the full-sized microwaves, but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint.  It's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive.  The rounded back works well for our needs, as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit.  After a few months of use, I'm quite pleased with this purchase."
1357,5,3,4,"Small but Mightly I purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space.  Since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn, this microwave is perfect.  I held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws.  I removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it.  Once removed, there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate.  My old microwave didn't have an open space.  My concern was that if I heat soup, it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space.  It still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave.  Oh well, this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times I used on my old microwave.  Yes, I'd purchase this again but I'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door."
1363,5,1,1,"Great Buy Very happy with this purchase. For the money, great product.<br /><br />I was a little concerned, because some had mentioned the clunky door, but I find no problems with it."
1367,5,11,13,"works great, looks cool I have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside. It works great and looks pretty cool.  I was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does!!! So, it works for all my needs. Maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking I do anyway so it's fine for me."
1368,5,2,2,"Thanks Sharp Thanks Amazon We bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome.<br />The combination of an outside hood vent, range light, convection oven, and microwave made it a bargain as well.<br />The shipping was perfect. It was packed in 2 boxes, first the manufacture's styro lined box, then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box.<br />The stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great!<br />Thanks Sharp, Thanks Amazon"
1372,3,1,2,"average microwave It is a very compact microwave and will fit well in a tight space.  The power is quite low and heat things very slowly, sometimes painfully slow. if you have a small kitchen, this will work OK, but be prepared to put up with slow heating and not so easy to use controls."
1373,5,4,4,"Perfect for NYC apartments Everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks.  This powerful machine is perfect for the typical Manhattan kitchen.  If you are looking for a stylish, functional and space saving microwave - then buy this one!"
1374,2,0,0,PEM31SMSS GE Profile randomly shuts off This PEM31SMSS GE Profile Spacemaker unit intermittently powers off while cooking. There seems to be a power supply issue. If you unplug for a few seconds and plug back in (I have to reset the clock) it will work again until it powers off randomly again. Not sure what is up.  I have contacted the Amazon seller and am awaiting instructions for returning and getting a new unit. I have a old (8+ yr old) full size GE Profile Spacemaker 2 that has never had any issue which I will continue to use until I get a replacement unit.
1377,5,3,5,"Great  Little  Microwave I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working. We wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee. We needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area. This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online. It is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. The controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. This microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice. At only 750 watts, it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave.<br />Although the price was  higher that a comprable-sized microwave, the size and shape make it worth the extra money."
1380,1,1,2,poor quality and service This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
1381,5,2,2,"Just right! I love this little microwave oven.  I just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners, so I wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog, was easy to open and easy to clean, and didn't have a lot of fancy options that I never use.  Previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time, and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments (so there's a lot of pushing the + button), so I guess there's still room for improvement, but it does exactly what I want it to.  What I particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it.  Very easy to wipe clean, no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry."
1382,5,9,9,"smallspace I love this microwave.  It is the perfect size for a small space, it looks nice, and it cooks well for a 750 watt.  The first one I received would not latch and Whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one, even though I did not purchase it directly from them."
1388,5,4,6,"no brand name on front There is no brand name of the front of this appliance, which is nice because you can then pair it with your other appliances that may be a different brand. Which in my case was Whirlpool...just a note: Whirpool and Amana are one in the same.<br />I had it installed by a professional. I do not know if it was difficult to install. This is not a direct wire appliance, you will need an outlet in the cupboard above in order to plug it in.<br />So far no complaints. I have not had much time to use it...1 week since installation."
1389,5,2,2,Sharp Convection Microwave My wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it. I had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think I would be that impressed with this new model. I was wrong. This is one of the best appliances that I've ever purchased.
1391,5,6,8,"RG Absolutely love it! Takes up very little counter space - large inside, great height, would highly recommend. Purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have. Many compliments from guests; everyone wants to know where they can order one."
1398,4,8,8,"Size Matters This arrived incredibly fast and features were as advertised.  However, do be aware that the height is listed as 15 and 1/2 and this was a primary consideration as I was replacing a microwave in a tight space.  Sure enough, the front is 15 and 1/2; however, the unit slopes to 16 and 1/2 at the back."
1402,5,20,20,"great affordable microwave I don't find this microwave any noisier than others I've owned. I also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions. So far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful. Great basic, affordable microwave."
1403,5,2,2,"Fantastic replacement - works Replaced an existing OTR microwave that had a burnt out magnetron. It's been several months since install, and I am still very happy.<br /><br />1) Carousel works.<br />2) Has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 1-9 minute intervals Can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart.<br />3) Nukes food up really quickly.<br />4) Very easy to install. Even with a old house, I used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame. Took me two hours, and I was able to pop it in place all by myself.<br />5) Vent does a good job at sucking.<br /><br />Got it in fast, and in great condition. If you need a cheap replacement, this is it."
1404,5,0,0,microwave This is a great small microwave. It fits in a small area. Replaces an existing. This works much better. Do recommend
1405,5,9,11,"Absolutely Love It! Two days in and I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Small foot print, excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate. It's also the quietest microwave I have ever owned. You can barely hear it. The LCD is super bright and the controls are so easy to use. I love how the entire front sure is flat - makes for really easy clean up. I would so buy this again and again."
1409,2,8,10,"Defect...... Apparently From The  Manufacture GE Purchased this product from Warehouse Deals (Fulfilled by Amazon) which was advertised as USED but in GOOD condition, microwave oven arrived April 28, 2012. The product did not work and the door was damaged. Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1, 2012, who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage. He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return. On May 5, 2012 the parts arrived, notified GE immediately and a tech representative  would be responding Monday May 7, 2012. I don't know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS. I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it? Just a note...reading all the bad reviews on this particular GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) I'm contemplating  having additional problems with this particular GE microwave. I really had no choice, this unit replaced my old GE Profile Spacemaker microwave (JEM31SF01) that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet; as I required the exact dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers.<br /><br />Update 5/9/12: The GE technical representative responded to my residence Monday 5/7/2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts. The new door still did not align properly with the frame. The rep contacted GE and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly. A decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement. I will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from GE.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12: A brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation/repair company sub-contracted by GE. One of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use. The gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave's more than any other GE microwave. With all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model (PEM31SMSS) what's the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time???..... Mediocre To Put It Mildly. As I previously indicated, I had no recourse, since I needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet, with the correct dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers; these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone. In conclusion, I would recommend everyone to purchase a different model GE or a different brand all together.oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use.

1410,4,26,30,"Nice, compact, easy to use Whirlpool's description of this microwave is spot on.<br /><br />The only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad, but there really isn't space given the compact design.<br /><br />We have oversized dinner plates, and they fit in here with very little to spare, which means this microwave is perfect for us."
1412,5,6,6,"Working fine after 4 months We bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one, to fit into a space in our cabinets, and this was the closest. A bonus was the turntable, which my husband really likes.  It is larger inside than the old one, and more powerful, in the same space!  We have used it 4 months now with no issues at all.  The door does close and open rather hard, so we ease it closed, otherwise we love it! The controls are very easy to use.  We had a bit of trouble installing it, we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave  to slip onto the bracket, so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it, and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top.  A good choice if it becomes available again."
1415,5,7,8,Love it! Perfect replacement for my old one.  It is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme.  I can nuke larger items now.
1416,4,7,10,"Fits a need. Bought to fit in an 18 kitchen base cabinet, hidden behind a door. 1000 watts would be better, but this is the only choice for my requirements. I like the simple controls, as I use it only to rewarm leftovers and melt butter and chocolate."
1421,4,2,5,"Cool Cooler! I bought this fridge for my college son who lives on his computer. The only setback is that he says it doesn't accomodate larger cans of drinks. Other than that, he says it is the coolest invention!"
1422,4,3,3,"Works Great! I received the item before the expected date-package and it's contents were intact, no issues at all with delivery.<br /><br />I used it the day I received it; after reading the many helpful hints in these online reviews, it was very simple and easy to use. It works great for me, for small loads in my apartment-I live alone and don't have large amounts of laundry to wash.<br /><br />The tube they supply to fill up the tub didn't fit onto my faucet, but I have a plastic pitcher I used to fill it (three pitchers full, easy peasy). When in use, it sits right on my kitchen counter and the drain tube empties the water directly into my sink. The Panda is fairly quiet, if I have music or the tv on, I can't hear it at all.<br /><br />It's really been a huge help to me, and I use it often. I am planning on getting a mini-electric dryer as well, then I will only have to visit the laundrymat once a month, if that. I highly recommend the Panda-it's just so darn cute, and works like a charm with small loads."
1423,3,1,1,Fine It is the right price but it is not the same size as it says.  We had the exact same one just a little older and this one was slightly smaller.  1/4 on all sides.
1433,5,10,11,"My Sharp R-520KS2-Cubic-Foot 1200-Watt Microwave This is the first 1,200 watt microwave I've ever owned. It took just a while to figure out I didn't need things to heat as long, but once I figured it out, it is the best microwave I've ever owned. The only drawback I have is I wish the completed beeper was louder. Other than that, I am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave."
1437,4,9,11,"A bit noisy Everything so far seems to be working great.  We've only owned it for a few weeks but other than it being just a bit noisier than the old one we replaced, we are very happy with it.  Also the power is the same as the one we replaced it for but it seems to take about 15-20% longer cooking time than the old one.  The size of the microwave is larger than the old one, so maybe that is the reason it takes longer to cook.  Other than that I would still buy the same microwave over again if I had to do it all over again.  Great deal for the money."
1439,4,2,4,"Expensive but a good buy We bought this oven based upon our son's usage of an earlier model.  There aren't that many drawer microwaves available.  Why buy a drawer microwave?  Well, the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house!  Her arguments were as follows:  1) no need to lift or inspect foods over her head, 2) made space for a vent. While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above (top), our new house didn't have any vent.  So, all cooking fumes were vented into the room.  With this oven, we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood (above the range).  Still, not perfectly ventalated.  I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave.  Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker, but a problem or extra costs for others.  In addition, I had to add an electrical outlet.  Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer, but maybe a cost for others.  After the installation, simple enough, the drawer didn't want to stay closed.  That is, you push the close button and the drawer closed but re-opened immediately.  I was about to call for service but I did the following:  push the drawer closed manually, that is by hand.  This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay.  So, no service call required.  The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table.  Dispite this, we are happy with this model so far after about a year.  Shorter people may like this oven a lot, and, it is REALLY COOL!  So, I would recommend this oven."
1441,4,24,26,"Perfect for a small kitchen I love this microwave.  It takes up barely any space on the counter, and the cord is well hidden behind it.  It works fine for just heating things up and defrosting.  The only thing to be aware of is that this really is a tiny microwave. You can fit a full size dinner plate, but there is not a lot of height inside.  I couldn't use my microwave rice cooker in this because it was too tall, so I had to purchase a counter top rice cooker instead, which doesn't seem to work as well.  Other than that, this microwave looks good on the counter and does the job."
1443,1,5,7,"2nd Try and Fail We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
1444,4,2,3,"Satisfied The Haier Microwave was exactly as discribed and installed easily. It replaced a 10yo Hotpoint over the counter which began the fail and finally threw electrial flashes and died. As a low cost replacement, the Haier was the best I could find."
1447,5,5,6,"Good product Good quality product.  Installed well and works great.  Some reviewers commented on the way the door closes, but I have found it to be just fine.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  I would recommend.  3/2013 Update:  The microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year.  Very pleased with it.  With lots of use and much by teenagers, it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far.  It also cooks very efficiently.  Still happy and would still recommend."
1455,4,44,46,Very good value I ordered this Microwave to replace my 15 year old GE microwave/vent hood which had finally given up the ghost (after multiple repairs). I was pleased that I could install it myself using the templates and instructions included. It has fewer features than the expensive model it replaced but it works quite well and includes all the important features including the ability to use the existing vent or to vent into the room.
1457,5,1,1,"Great Microwave This item works great, was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen. Exactly what it says in the description, arrived on time. We have no complaints whatsoever with this item. I would definitely recommend it!"
1458,4,8,9,"Good price for basic features I bought this particular microwave oven because it would fit in the space over our stove and the price was very good. It's worked well, without any problems since I bought it a few months ago. My only complaint is that you can't have the timer going and cook something in the microwave at the same time. I've never had a microwave that couldn't do that so that's a little disappointing."
1459,4,1,1,Great microwave I looked everywhere for this microwave.  I had the same one a few years ago and wanted the same one in white because I wanted  to match it with my new kitchen.  It is not too big nor too small.  It was the perfect depth for my shelf in my kitchen.  Reliable appliance!
1460,3,12,15,"Not exactly what I was expecting I purchased this microwave to match other Frigidaire appliances I have, with price in mind. I missed that you don't have the ability to turn off the turntable on this model--it seems like that should be standard anymore. If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation, the turntable function can be damaged. I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time. I'll get used to that, though. It gives three long beeps when the time is up, which is kind of annoying to me for some reason. Even when you open the door, the beeps continue. I haven't used it much yet. I tried the popcorn feature, and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for. I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button. But if I'd had more time (home construction--it arrived and was installed right away) and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return, I would have returned it and opted for a different model. It looks nice, and I'm sure it will be fine."
1461,4,2,2,"Good for a basic microwave - noisy though This looks good and does what it is designed to do. My main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy, but as I only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal."
1462,1,3,3,"Very disappointed with its reliability I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly."
1467,5,0,0,good buy it works
1468,5,11,17,"Ministerdwf Wow, Wow, Wow! I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. I know you will too."
1469,1,4,4,"cheap and poor quality- do not buy When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer"
1471,5,16,17,"Great inexpensive OTR microwave The first time I used it, I was disappointed with it, but I don't know if it just got better, or if I pushed the wrong button the first time because it's been great since. Nice and roomy interior, easy to install (I did it completely by myself, though I recommend you have a friend). I did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first, so I had to take it down to do that, but once you get the frame mounted on the wall, that part is easy. The hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above... I'm not sure how they could have made it any easier though, the problem is mostly a matter of physics.    I would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range."
1473,2,2,3,"Poor Quality After 1 year of light use (maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers), the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything.  The cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth."
1477,5,4,4,It's fine three years later! I have had this microwave three years.  The only problem I ever have with it is that the door sticks sometimes.  I just have to tug on it every once in a while.  The oven works consistently and does everything it should.  The defrost stops intermittently to tell you to turn things over or separate them or whatever.  That is sometimes helpful and sometimes not -- If I have just one chicken breast in there to defrost I have to hit the button to resume defrost about three or four times.  I do respond by turning the chicken over one of those times.  I defintely recommend the microwave.
1480,5,2,4,Great addition to our kitchen The GE Profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  Very satisfied with our purchase.
1488,1,1,4,"Mixed Feelings Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button."
1492,1,6,7,Very disapointed I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA. Different issues. Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory. I won't purchase another sharp microwave. The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me. I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely. I'm not happy at all.
1493,5,131,134,"Microwave paint fix that works My daughter had a GE microwave/oven combo. The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem. The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />To my amazement, it did! Now it wasn't easy, I had to degrease the inside of the oven (TSP), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. I used PaintStriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />Pro - Followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. So about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />Cons - The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST .  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house. The paint does dry very fast in about an hour."
1494,5,2,2,great product!!!! Great product.  Fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm.  Sleek and effective!
1495,3,3,5,"Stopped working after 2 months The microwave looks good, but stopped heating after 2 months.  I am on hold now with Sharp customer service. The space saving design is nice, but don't like waiting for the drawer to open/close. The controls being 4' off the ground are tempting for my 3yr old."
1496,5,6,8,outstanding! this microwave is incredible!  very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great!  easy to use and to clean!
1497,5,8,11,"Outstanding! My Sharp drawer microwave is so much more than I even hoped for.  It is convenient.  The button to open and button to close OR easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself!  Love that!  I had to REPROGRAM myself to go easy to get it opening or closing, then let it finish all by itself.  I was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 1/2 second that I used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut.  It's good for me to slow down for 2 seconds!  There are more single cook options than I have used yet. I really like the push START once to get one minute cook time, 2 pushes for 2 minutes, etc.  Can do the same to add a minute while cooking.  SENSOR REHEAT and SENSOR COOK buttons are useful, but as in prior microwaves, I have to still keep a check on how it's cooking.  It seems to cook evenly, but I probably will get a windup turntable if I can still find one.    It holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare.  The 1000W power cooks fast.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!"
1498,4,4,4,"Perfect For My Needs I wanted a microwave that took up as little counter space as possible, had sensor cooking and was easy to use.  This one fit all that criteria and had a bonus:  a Beverage key which I use a lot to heat water to the perfect temp for tea.  This microwave is perfect for my needs and I'm very happy with it.  The only downside is that the quality is only average."
1499,2,4,7,"Small and Underpowered... The box was somehow very light, and right then, I knew we had made a mistake.      This microwave is almost like a toy.  It is very tiny and underpowered.  We unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn. Well, it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop.  After 3-4 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped.  Forget it. It must have been broken, or maybe just for making things warm, not hot.    We returned it right away. Speedy return system!"
1502,4,4,5,"Great Cusomer Service This unit is a replacement for an identical item that arrived with concealed damage.  I notifed Amazon around 3pm the day it arrived and received word that a replacement unit had been ordered and it would take several days to process the order.  Two hours later, I received notification that the replacement unit had been shipped!  It arrived at 9:15 the next morning!  Outstanding customer service effort by Amazon.    This microwave replaced a 2002 Sharp model identical in size, power and other features.  The first thing I noticed is that it takes 30% to 40% longer to heat compared to the older model, even after 8 years of use.  This is across the board, not just on certain items.  Also, the keypad has been reconfigured with the start and stop buttons situated in between rows of other buttons instead of separated from other buttons as on the older model.  The buttons are also smaller and it is easy to push the wrong button if you get in a hurry.  I will say it is a more attractive unit and a lot quieter than the older model."
1511,1,4,4,Not Recommended Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.
1512,5,9,10,"After much research online... After our old Microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores.  I purchased Consumer Reports for microwaves and then searched for them on Amazon to read the customer reviews.  The top ten rated had horrible customer reviews.  So then decided to search from the bottom of the list up, and this is when I found our next microwave.  Loud was the only beef with this microwave.  Now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave.  Basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud.  But the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast, even heat with the turning tray is awesome!  This is used several times a day and after a month no complaints!"
1514,5,2,2,Sharp Microwave My husband & I were looking for a microwave for my daughter & her husband for a Christmas gift.  This is the same brand that we have & are very happy w/ it.  This is exactly what we were looking for & so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price.  Their home is nearing completion & they are so excited to install this microwave & start using it.  Our daughter said that she just loves the modern look & knows that it'll look wonderful w/ all their other stainless steal appliances.
1517,5,0,0,An excellent product at a great price We've owner this product for several years now.  It looks nice and works great.  Amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don't need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition.
1518,4,2,2,"purchased on a whim As good or better than i hoped! Lots of options, fan is great. It is noisier than my old one (as per other reviews) but really...it doesn't matter that much."
1520,5,6,8,"Amazing Microwave We have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it!  Well worth the price.  It is super convenient, you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven.  Cooks evenly and quickly.  Easy to use and clean. Very attractive, a conversation piece as well."
1523,5,5,6,Maybe best Micro/Convection built. After owning a previous Sharp microwave/convection oven I bought this one.  Installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed.  Excellent even microwave and oven performance.  Highly recommend this product.
1525,4,4,6,"Nice Looking Good Customer Service So Far The installation dimensions in the install guide are exactly right.  I worried about trusting them, but they worked very well.    Looks real nice, works well, and was very easy to install.    One issue, When the drawer closed, it made a squeeking sound.  I figured it was going back into the box and getting shipped back.  We called Sharp and they sent out a technician who diagnosed the problem and ordered a replacement part.  We'll have to update if things go south with that, but so far, I appreciated the customer service.    Four stars because of the squeaking drawer, but not one star because the customer service was so good."
1527,4,6,8,Great Microwave Microwave is very spacious; works well and is very powerful...  We love this unit.. Arrived with faulty circuit card; would not heat up.  Sharp Warranty personnel were here within 2 days and fixed it.
1530,4,1,1,"Everything Microwave Right size, cooks everything, Fast and convenient.  Just right for my needs. Can't go wrong with the deal or the unit."
1534,5,1,1,"Very Pleased Excellent price and product (2 day shipping with Amazon Prime - another really good investment!). This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. It fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. Oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). Everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). I put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. Really like the sensor cooking (so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). Definitely recommend this oven."
1536,5,3,4,REVIEW MAGIC CHEF THIS IS AWESOME! LOVE IT! IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL! COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL! AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY! VERY HAPPY OVERALL!
1541,4,2,2,"Decent low-cost over the range This unit was a replacement for a slightly earlier model that failed.  It is nice that the LG over-the-range family generally uses the same wall-mount, so installation was easy as a replacement.   It works fine, though if you are a heavy users of microwaves, I am not sure what the real durability is, but since we are light users, the prior model lasted several years, and expect this will too."
1543,5,3,4,"Sharp Microwave Review The Microwave works beautifully.  The installation instructions left something to be desired, but we figured it out."
1545,5,1,1,Microwave - It's great! This black LG over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    We're happy customers!
1547,1,9,9,"Sitting in My Garage We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent."
1551,1,20,21,"Terrible quality I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this."
1557,5,4,5,Good Family size Microwave. This Sharp Microwave is Great for a Family. Its Large size is a big plus.  Easy operation and nice finish and very powerful.   We had an LG oven before and it is a JUNK ! It lasted only 2 years.  Our old Microwave was a Sharp also and its still working after 20+ years!  My rating A+++
1559,4,7,7,"good basic microwave I bought this microwave to replace my previous Sharp R-1449.  This one is deeper, more plastic, and slightly more powerful.  It seems reliable (only have had it 6 weeks), has a good vent and good stove lights.  I wish it had a night light and a switch to stop turntable rotation though one can get around it by removing the turntable. My biggest disappointment was that it utilizes a different mounting plate than my previous Sharp microwave.    I gave it four stars b/c it does the job and it was inexpensive compared to other manufacturers. Incidentally, mounting instructions were very good."
1561,5,29,32,"Gorgeous, Efficient and Chic! This microwave is wonderful. The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. If you read Consumer Reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. Not so. This has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. Very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. For the installation/do-it-yourselfers: It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. Follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. The directions are very good. Note: If you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. The mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and I got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. I recommend this microwave highly!"
1564,4,69,70,"Decent oven, inexpensive, not too bad to install. I bought this oven to replace a Whirlpool of equal size. I like the LG. It's a little more powerful, and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well. It's a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts. Get those right and the installation is no big deal. It does take two people to horse this 60 lb. appliance into place while starting the bolts, threading the cord etc.    It took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and I was a cabinet installer in my youth. Still, no big deal.    Tip: use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet."
1567,4,3,17,over the range microwave The microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition.  We have tested it to make sure it works.  It was just installed so we haven't used it a lot yet.....completely happy...excellent Amazon service as usual.
1575,5,7,8,microwell report This appliance works much better than my last sharp. As for noise complaint I didn't find it to much different than my old microwave. Only bad part about stainless steel is that you see all the fingerprints everywhere. Really liked the speedy service.
1577,5,19,22,"Deliberated long & hard -- 520KS Great Choice After too much research, I settled on this terrific microwave.  Every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction-no help horror story. So in the end, if you chance having a microwave at all, this one seems better than most, if not all.  It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars.  At home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  Both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles. When I designed my kitchen twenty years ago, I made two below-counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave. I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  They have been great workhorses.  The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances (including Bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R-408LS Carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's ($99) as a replacement. The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-W with Sharp's R-520KS microwave as well. The display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition. Knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term, I can only say they are 5+ stars as week-old additions to my kitchen. The microwaves do everything I want powerfully and quickly. The cost, especially with Amazon Prime shipping, closed the deal."
1580,5,6,7,"Delighted overall For the price I don't think you can beat this Sharp microwave.  I just wanted a basic microwave that did the job.  I was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and I was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the Sharp would be inadequate.  My fears were groundless as the Sharp functions every bit as fast the older one.  I like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle.  They recommend two people to mount this oven, however since I didn't have help available I was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought.  If I were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas, mainly in the venting info.  All-in-all a good buy."
1582,5,7,7,"Sharp Over the Range Convection Microwave Oven You will be surprised at the amount and size of food this oven will accomodate.  It cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices.  I bought this because my other Sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use.  I was used to the Sharp features which made it the logical choice.  At the same time, I wanted to replace my conventional oven (also 11 yrs. old) because it never baked evenly.  With the Sharp micro/convection combo, I no longer have to replace my conventional range oven - I'll use it for storage."
1584,5,43,44,"Great Microwave!  I highly recommend it! I bought the Sharp R-520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving.  I did alot of research before I bought this one.  I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  Now I had an excuse to replace it.  I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look I wanted.  I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one.  This microwave works great!  I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  It has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  There are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  The ones I have used so far work great!  My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  Not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.  The microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  All in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking, powerful, counter top microwave."
1586,4,3,3,Sharp R-1406 micrave I had a same model of microwave which worked for me about   4to 5 years very good and that was the reason I ordered the same brand and model again .  the new one so far has been very good too but the one way blocking door over the exhaust fan was noisy which I swapped it with the  older one and fixed the problem overall is very good and I like it.
1587,5,3,3,works great this was a great buy!! I read the other reviews and they are right on the money. Easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great.
1588,4,0,0,turntable plate horrible After one year the turntable plate cracked while we were making a bag of popcorn.  Very strange indeed!  Now trying to find a replacement as I really miss the food items turning while cooking!  Other than that it is still working in top notch condition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This microwave died after only 2 years. Was hoping to get more out of it then we did.
1589,1,10,13,Darn Door I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut.  I had to send it back.  Darn.  Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem.  I am pleased with Amazon's service.
1591,4,3,5,"sharp microwave Great help in the installation, smaller oven size than ge or sears. Display could have larger numbers. No handle to open door."
1593,5,6,7,A fine microwave at a fantastic price Love it! Love it! Love it!  My Sharp microwave of 10 years finally died.  It had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape.  We looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from.  This one was built with the same quality as my old one and I don't doubt it will last as long.
1595,4,5,6,good but large microwave This microwave works pretty good.  The sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly.  The only bad thing I've seen is that it's got a rather large footprint.
1596,5,6,10,"Great Product from Amazon We really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from Amazon.  It really has a good convection oven, although is somewhat noisy with the fan.  It was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions.  Amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere."
1599,5,11,16,"Great Microwave & Even Greater Amazon Service This is a great microwave, especially with the $25 discount Amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over $125. But let me tell you why this purchase was extra special. I was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered (size, weight, fragile, etc) rather than from a local store .  But the selection at local stores like Best Buy was so bad, I placed the order. Unfortunately, the day it was supposedly delivered by UPS, no microwave arrived. I called UPS to see if I could start a tracer, but UPS told me that Amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package. I went to the customer service site, couldn't find a phone number, and used the e-mail system. I thought - great - that e-mail will disappear into the ether, I may never hear from anybody, and here I am without my microwave.  That was about 8pm local time when I sent the e-mail. <br /> <br />The next morning when I checked my e-mail, I got quite a surprise. An Amazon rep wrote back, apologized my package had been lost, and re-ordered the item for me. Before too long, I had an e-mail the item was already shipping via 2-day delivery, and sure enough, 2 days later I had the replacement package. Wow! No hassle, no waiting, just great service. I couldn't believe it. I don't think I'll ever hesitate when I want to order something from Amazon again. I don't work for Amazon, they're not paying for this - I've actually never written a product review before. I was just so impressed with the customer service, I had to write. <br /> <br />The final chapter - the day before the replacement microwave arrived, the person who lives in the next cul-de-sac over from us, with the same house number, and with a street name similar to ours, showed up with the original microwave that UPS had mistakenly delivered to them. I wrote Amazon customer service an e-mail, and once again after a very quick response, I was able to arrange for UPS to come pick up the extra package.  Thanks Amazon.  You're great."
1604,5,93,98,"Pleased I did not follow advise of other review, I love this I bought this on Amazon to replace a Sharp microwave, which has served me well for several years. Based on the price, compared to other with similar features, this unit is the least expensive. I was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation. I am closer to being Tim (the toolman) Taylor than a professional at home improvements, so I followed the instructions with precision. The results were outstanding. Not only does it look GREAT where my old stove hood used to be, it passed my popcorn test, of which, I am particular. No scotching, full bag, satisfying and an extra plus, while I am beaming over my accomplishment, the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished, the display read Enjoy. Am I ever! I have in my digital locker,courtesy of Amazon, my own .pdf manual. What a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit.<br /><br />Solidly built, looks great, came with lightbulbs for range light INSTALLED! No cons, but could have used some help with installing, as the manual recommends 2 people install, but I did manage nicely by myself. I would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion, once preparations are complete. I have only owned this for a day, but, I wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive, if they are on the edge, to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket.<br /><br />Panasonic wants like $300 for a comparable unit. I am pleased to pay 1/2 as much and get a quality unit such as this. You can even get this for $25 off before January 31st, free shipping (this dude is HEAVY!) and no tax, do the math, it is a steal!"
1605,3,56,61,It was a bit of a disappointment When we were remodeling our kitchen we decided to replace our Sharp countertop convection microwave with the over the range model. I really miss the old one. This new model seems to be a lot noisier than the old one. I went from 1.5 cubic feet down to 1.1 and it feels like I lost a lot more room than that. The hood light is VERY dim and the replacement bulbs (2) each cost at least $4 a piece if you can find them. Because we had to vent this into the kitchen we had to sent away to Sharp for a charcoal filter that cost $20 (filter plus shipping and handling.) We had planned to vent it to the outside but the vent didn't even come close to matching up the hole from our former range hood. The cooking turntable is white and very had to keep clean. It is only a month old and is very stained already.  <br />I do like to have the cooking area at eye level.  <br />I researched the price for comparable items on the web before buying and Amazon offered the best price as well as free shipping. I am very pleased with Amazon!
1606,1,16,19,"Bargain??? Mind the interior! One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine."
1612,4,19,19,"Great microwave, little tough to mount Its a pretty big and heavy unit so having someone around to help mount would be a good thing.  I found that sometimes the clips in the back have a little trouble popping in all the way, unless its lined up just right.<br />I didnt like the wall mount screws a whole lot as well as the fact there is only 4 to hold on the whole bracket (they note that you should have at least 2 in studs).  They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across, so what I did was located two studs, drilled some 1/16th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk (5) 1 3/4&quot; drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall.  I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove.<br />Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place, the bit can easily destroy the screw hole :)  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 1/2&quot; self tapping bolts.  So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard.. but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall!<br />As for functionality, the microwave is nice and powerful, the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door (you punch in the settings when you open it).  A note of caution, dont put anything in it without the carousel tray to heat.  I had a small paper nacho bowl in there and it almost started the glue on fire in 20 seconds.<br />Another note... The carousel tray does not ship in this box well, mine arrived broken in half.  My only option was to ship the whole unit back (weighs like 80 lbs).  I lucked out because my old microwave was a Sharp and the carousel tray is identical."
1613,3,6,6,"Sharp could be Sharper UPDATE: Yes i too had the door latch button melt and it does not function any longer it actually was replaced within the 1st year under warranty but now this has happened again a second time and i was only boiling water on the front burner, i see no use in paying for a second repair since i am currently using a pen to pop the door open i will of course have to replace the whole microwave in the near future & i will be soooo happy when i finally do i can't wait to ditch this appliance what a waste. next time I'm choosing a regular handle not a push button latch. Live & Learn   don't they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumer.....won't be buying anything from sharp company any time soon.   I purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model (emerson proffesional) stainless steel, I needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances.  I purchased it from Amazon for $275. lowest price I could find and am currently waiting on a $30.rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal.  It has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier.  My countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid $100. for it (on all sides) not just the front like this model  I installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability.  Exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates, unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low setting,wish it was quieter.The light has hi and low settings either is bright enough, more of a night light feature.  Overall it work fine and looks good. Not a high end unit but then again not a high end price.  It does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked, used it on potatoes which turned out great.At first I was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through UPS for fear it would arrive damaged but UPS did a fine job with handling.  Rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating."
