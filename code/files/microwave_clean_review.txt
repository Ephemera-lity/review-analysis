Do not recommend it go use your money for something more 3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it It was used twice a day Do not recommend it go use your money for something more durable Oh and also big plates do not fit in it
Looks as good as the picture Didn't use it long so I can't attest to that but for the price it is extremely good looking and feels like a quality build Just know it's small you will not be nuking turkeys in this and it's not super high wattage so it may take a bit longer So if you must have your canned soup in 212 minutes and not 3 then this won't work
Four Stars Very nice microwave great price
quiet Quiet but does not seem like 1000 watt power
Four Stars It's bigger than I thought
Great Microwave Really love this microwave Has the one touch settings that I wanted along with the +30 seconds button Its a great size for a countertop It can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said
Was pleased with the packaging and easy instructions to set it Was pleased with the packaging and easy instructions to set it up Worth $55 and that it was 'Prime34 order
Great Value for the Money Neat little unit I have no complaints
It had great reviews when we ordered it The finish is nice and matches our stainless steelblack wall oven nicely However the button to open the door no longer opens on the first try or needs some help And occasionally something internal to the microwave makes a noise when the tray is rotating
Great little microwave Excellent small microwave I recently moved to an apartment which did not have a builtin microwave but also a kitchen that wasn't that big This microwave was perfect for it Its footprint is small however it packs a punch All my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly The only downside is that when opening or closing the door the whole microwave sometimes may move as it's not the heaviest out there but I'm not going to fault it for that I just simply put my other hand on top of it while openingclosing
Four Stars Works Really Well
Five Stars Love this microwave Gives me more space in my kitchen only con is the price
I never used this for my wife insisted we buy I never used this for my wife insisted we buy a new microwave after I bought this I did contact GE and they gave me a 20$ credit and said not to worry about paint peeling off Tell that to your wife That was OK because I read some reviews which made it sound alittle difficult to use
 for about a week and so far it's been great the microwaving powder is quite strong Had this for about a week and so far it's been great the microwaving powder is quite strong but the grill plate is too high for some bulkier food that would be my only complain
I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating So sadly we had to send it back I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun
This is a funny story This is a funny storyyears ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for $2500 It was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely SMALL kitchen with very little counter space etc Recently I moved to a older home new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space No room for an over the range microwave My new little Whirlpool Cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen Love it Love it Love ithowever $2500 would have been an easier price on the pocket book LOL
Love to nuke Good price has continued to work very well since December 2014 8 months My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns I don't see what could cause the loose fit Nevertheless the carousel does turn just not very quietly Otherwise great buy It is still easy to clean I love using the 1 2 and 3 settings for onetouch cooking times of 1 2 or 3 minutes I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching 34Start34 one time Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large 34open34 button is pushed the entire microwave moves but I have not had that experience I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables popcorn potato etc I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking However it's fine for baking a potato I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior which contributes to the 14 cu ft interior volume But the size is right for me regardless Certainly this was the best buy on Amazon for my purposes
this is a great product The size is perfect and it works Although it slides when you open the door this is a great product The size is perfect and it works great Because of how my kitchen is designed I cant push my microwave against the wall If you can then your microwave will not slide
Four Stars Solid microwave for a good price
Timely delivery good product Prompt delivery my microwave is back up and running
Five Stars very attractive and useful mircorwave
Whirlpool WMC20005YW 05 cubic ft microwave white Although only 5 it holds a nice size dish I love that the controls are at the bottom Counter space is limited so this is peer Would be great in a dorm room too
Danby 11 cuft microwave good unit Unit is lighter than expected Cooks as expected Door latch is hard to push but not hard enough to move unit while opening Light comes on as unit runs not as door opens Buttons are convenient for cooking but read directions some difference to set power levels than other microwaves I have owned Went with this unit due to reviews size and price
Five Stars Extremly satisfied
Worked well on Sharp Carousel II Worked well on an old Sharp Carousel II Microwave 1 can was enough for 2 coats First make sure you sand down and prime any rust spots so they won't show through
Great purchase The microwave does the job and was Great purchase The microwave does the job and was a great price
Five Stars excellent results
Five Stars Works great product was as describer and delivered promptly and on time
Truckers Mucrowave Perfect for semi truck at 750 watts can run on1000 watt inverter
Gap on the top right I just received mine and when it's running you can see the interior light shinning through a gap on the top corner Not sure if this is normal or safe so I've submitted a question about it For now I'll give it a 3 star review for looks and the slightly annoying BANG the door makes when it closes pending any heating and an answer to my question I'll update then I'm attaching pictures of the gap UPDATE 9262015 Well the gap doesn't seem to be a normal feature but it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way I mostly use it for heating up leftovers and it works great for that purpose have not tried it for any serious cooking The loud door is far more tolerable now after a few uses barely noticeable Updating my review to 4 stars won't do five only because of that gap
Five Stars Works well with proper preparation
But it fits where we wanted it just perfect and we like the looks We ordered it for a boat that we are rebuilding not real sure how its going to work yet But it fits where we wanted it just perfect and we like the looks That is about all I can tell you at the present time Terry
Five Stars Good
It's pretty powerful It looks as if there are many Needed one in a hurry and my teen bought this It's pretty powerful It looks as if there are many brands that are actually this same machine
What a great unit Took some fiddling to install but the What a great unit Took some fiddling to install but the unit itself is really very nice
The fabuous whirlpool mini I had found a small blue cube micro wave some years ago After 16 years of service it finally wore out I love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem I couldn't be happier It is the great same size the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave Would not hesitate to purchase this again Totally worth the price
Five Stars Love LG products Got product in a timely manner
Nothing special but fits the bill Works well enough for my purposes Just the right size I dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds start and minutes number buttons It's also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy What brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves ¨C?super tiny and the handle While this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well that doesn't make for a good combination for opening the door So I have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door I think this could be solved with some super rubber feet but I shouldn't have to add them myself
Received defected item Came in brand new package but item doesn't work at all
but it heats quickly and is very easy to clean You can't use the 34cook34 feature with a timer going on the machine but it heats quickly and is very easy to clean
Five Stars Got it sooner thank you
it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work The surface light and the vent fan works fine I really should try it before I install it Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online
Easy install Looks great Works great Lighter than the GE one it replaced Easy simple to use TouchPad Installation was easy and I am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances I usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right You just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place
Great microwave I would purchase again Install was really easy and the microwave looks and works great The buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily
Amazon reviews were misleading One of my worst Amazon purchases I hate this microwave and deeply regret purchasing it It is GIANT and heavy sits crooked on a flat surface and heats food unevenly You can get WAY better for LESS MONEY Shocked because usually Amazon reviews are so spot on
Five Stars Just installed it that part was easy
I couldn't enjoy our travels in our RV if I didn't have I couldn't enjoy our travels in our RV if I didn't have my Sharp convectionmicrowave oven I just love it 
Excellent Microwave does the job Excellent product does the job I have one in my home and when an older overthestove unit failed in a rental I immediately ordered another A few things are tricky in the install but were easily and quickly resolved Tenants happy I'm happy In this case the older unit had limited functionality the Whirlpool has several features new to them that are real benefits
Five Stars love it
Great drawer microwave We really like the look of this microwave We used the same model in our last home and liked it and just had a new home built and chose to have the same model installed in our new kitchen We have never had any issues with it It is classy looking large enough for a casserole dish and heats well
microwave worked fine when I bought back in March '15 microwave worked fine when I bought back in March '15 then a few days ago it would not turn on Will not buy Danby microwaves again
to the point where it's annoying If I had known this before I purchased When you close the door it is VERY loud to the point where it's annoying If I had known this before I purchased it I would have bought a more expensive one to not deal with the noise every time it closes The plastic covering the buttons is already ripping had it for less than a year Other than that it works fine
Still in the box Purchased this for college student and it has not been used yet Still in the original box Looks nice however
Five Stars Awesome
but it is a little slow and worse of all it has no way to quickly add Microwave and reheat function works well but it is a little slow and worse of all it has no way to quickly add 30 seconds or a minute You must always either select a mode or manually enter the cook time before starting
Five Stars Very good item
Love it I was reluctant to get a microwave because of limited counter space that I have in my tiny apartment so I talked myself out of not needing a microwave But then I realize how convenient it is to have one and found this one that's just the right size that's when I knew I had to get it But don't let its size fool youit can fit a full sized dinner plate Five star for sleek design and function Love it
Great price great microwave The microwave does what it's supposed to do and is easy to use I like the express settings so when you press any single digit it automatically puts in that amount of minutes It is great for urban kitchen needs For smaller kitchens doesn't take up too much space or for bringing up flights of stairs it is nice and light Really compact heats up food well Great for the price
Very good but smelly Our microwave was working fine but had a number of rusty spots I cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal There was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior ie to give a uniform color appearance The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out You could still smell it a couple of weeks later But eventually it went away Overall I'm happy The 10yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too
A real beauty What a beautiful micro I love it Works great
Very satisfied For the low price it works very well Compact and nice looking
excellent Excellent I love the shape and size perfect for a small kitchen
Better than expected Had not heard of this brand Was a little unsure about purchasing Really nice looking and very quiet Great value
Five Stars very good
Five Stars This is the best most efficient little microwave we have ever had
Five Stars Easily installed it is both attractive and operates easily
This is the perfect size for the space we have and I think This is the perfect size for the space we have and I think it's the only one that will fit And good quality
Not very happy with the new design I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave has identical size and older model does not exist Two aspects were problematic from the prior model one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly So had to drill one more screw However the two screws are not symmetrical ie the distance from the sides of the microwave are different This is bad engineering as the center of gravity is not the center Second the interior is grey so we cannot be see the food cooking Moreover the bottom of the outside panel is tinted or black so unless you are 6 ft tall you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light Further the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket which was located at the top of the microwave carton bent thankfully we had the older one we did not have to use it Overall disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models
Four Stars I wonder if they will ever produce a microwave that only beeps once
Five Stars I m happy with it
Looks great Works great Looks great Works great I've been using it since May probably daily and haven't had any issues at all It's stainless on the inside as well so it wipes clean easily Food and beverages seem to heat evenly Great deal
Five Stars Love the versatality of this oven
Great Microwave It's large but heats food up quickly and is easy to use Only 4 star because of it's size Make sure you have room Mine is above my fridge which makes the push button to open the door ideal rather than pulling the door handle
We've been very happy with this We've been very happy with this Not sure I liked the dial at first but being able to dial in extra time is quick and efficient
PoS I received the microwave and it didn't even work I didn't have the original packaging so they wouldn't refund me Brilliant lol
Good value for price Low power but gets the job done and good value for the money As a den microwave or as a small office microwave this is perfect and an excellent value Takes a bit longer than larger units due to lower power but works well
Sleek Samsung microwave with grillcombi feature Prompt delivery and great looking microwave I cannot wait to try out grill function I already went through instruction book to familiarize myself with the functionality
Five Stars Great Product
Disappointed I purchased this microwave in January of 2015 In July of 2015 the microwave completely stop working The whole microwave stop working the clock everything I want to get my money back Most microwaves last for years I have had a microwave that lasted for 25 years To have a microwave last for only 6 months is disappointing
The most adorable little microwave around I only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when I bought my new house and it didn't have a microwave in the kitchen I was kind of like meh no biggie However after several weekends of cold coffee I caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY WITH THIS It's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want If you do 34cooking34 with a microwave then this isn't your best option But if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you Have I mentioned how cute it is?
Just the right size We replaced our overtherange microwave with a range hood We needed a small microwave to install in our pantry and this fit the bill It holds a 1234 plate and has multiple power levels for cooking but we use it mostly for rewarming It does take about twice as long as our old microwave but that's okay One feature I really like is the onetouch button for speed cooking Start will zap something for 30 seconds on high 1 = 1 minute 2 = 2 minutes etc That is quick and handy
Microwave Died within Six Months I bought this microwave for my parents for Christmas After six months it died My father has been attempting to get his refund processed for the past month and they keep giving him the run around Don't buy this product
Nice looking This is a nice looking unit It arrived right on schedule and was well packaged so no damage Plus all the features seem to work I particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit My only complaint was as noted by a couple of others the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places Fortunately I didn't do the install myself a pro did itor the micro would have been on the way back to 34home34 The unit matches my other LG appliances so I'm pretty happy I'll update this after I've used the micro for a while Ta y'all
Four Stars Not a powerhorse but great on space for my tiny kitchen
Five Stars It works just fine
This unit is unusual and special due to its vertical dimensions I needed a vertical microwave to fit a special spot in my galley This unit has proven to have both the power and interior space to meet all my needs
Excellent part Excellent quality Fixed our $500 microwave Learned that mfg offer 10 year warranty
Terrible microwave doesn't heat the food yet the outside Terrible microwave doesn't heat the food yet the outside of the microwave gets hot never had a microwave that gets hot on the outside working with the supplier to replace it
Three Stars The microwave is fine but the shipping was terrible
Read The Manual And You Will Be Rewarded I was a bit concerned after reading some of the ratings but I took the plunge and I'm glad I did It does everything as good or better than advertised As with most products the manual could stand some extra effort simplification so those who don't read it do so at their own peril Both my wife and I are pleased with this product and hope it lasts as long as my original Samsung 11 years
Does the job but not Elegant Firstit's pretty big something to considering if you live in an NYC apartment Secondthe door makes a pretty loud noise when you close the door Thirdthere's a noise coming from the unit which sounds like the glass plate is shaking every time I use it Overall it heats up my food That's all I really need
Good value Getting good use in a small office and working well Seems to be well built and holding up well in a tough environment Good value
Five Stars Good
Small space big job This has been a great little addition The plate is as large as a that of a larger microwave but this fits in smaller space in this case in a corner
Works as expected and seem to do the job Simple and basic microwave Works as expected and does the job Perfect for limited space on a countertop
Five Stars Received product as described and expeditiously A++++
So far so good Just a month no issues no particular shortcomings nothing really outstanding just working as a reasonable microwave should
It's a microwave The buttons feel cheap Also It's a microwave The buttons feel cheap Also before you purchase go somewhere and see a microwave that is 7 cubic feet Literally can't even microwave a hamster it's so small
Five Stars Super
Great little microwave Love this microwave It fit perfectly in the area I wanted it to I wanted a simple smaller microwave and this fit the bill Most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me It is very attractive I wanted some stainless to match my other appliances I have another Danby product dehumidifier and find Danby to be a good product In one review I read it said the microwave slid when opening the door I haven't found this to be a problem at all The price for this is great Would definitely recommend it
Great for a small kitchen So far so good It's just big enough to fit my large ikea plates I didn't think it would be so I was pleasantly surprised I didn't want to sacrifice counter space and this was the best option It seems to heat up pretty well Sometimes it takes a little longer than other microwaves but for me an extra minute isn't a big deal For the size and price it's a fantastic buy EDIT Just thought I'd update It's been 2 years and it's still going strong No issues whatsoever It works just as well as when I purchased it
Four Stars It's OK
Four Stars Perfect for our backroom Very pleased with the product
I can have microwave popcorn again What can you say about a part that fits specific applications? It replaced the broken turntable motor in the microwave Now the microwave doesn't burn things on one side and leave the rest cold So it's great that the microwave is works again The motor was considerably cheaper than having to get a new microwave which is the best thing about it It was easy to swap out once the cover was removed from the bottom of the microwave Getting to the turntable motor in a counter top microwave takes a chisel or snips etc to cut the tabs holding the cover panel to the sheet metal bottom of the oven Then it's just a case of removing one screw and unplugging a connector Just reverse the process and its back in place and you are in business The cover plate may need a screw to hold it in place when you reassemble the microwave It wasn't included with the motor but is easy enough to find at the hardware store or scavenge from some old unused electronics
Five Stars Excellent
Five Stars Works well
Great microwave I have had this microwave for about 5 months now and it is working perfectly The settings on the front are easy to use I regularly use the 30 second option on the 34start34 button and it cooks evenly 1100 Watts is good enough for everything I cook and I like the fact that there is a light when you open the door I think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but I do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute Plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying personal preference though It is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen I like the look of it too clean lines I knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless I hold it with the other hand Perhaps putting the microwave on a nonslip mat would solve that issue
So far so good I'm not enamored with the constant beeping when So far so good I'm not enamored with the constant beeping when things are done but when one of my kids use it it allows me to give them an evil stare ask them if they are using the microwave When I was looking to buy a new one I had my evil redheaded stepchild Relax he is over 21 check out the specifics of the 2 machines He said they were identical However this one is slightly larger performs much faster than the one it replaced Still not a problem but I have to wonder why the old one took much longer to perform the same thing
Poor quality Dont buy it The button will be defective after 8 months
As the wiseman said I have a happy life when I have a happy wife We had the olver range model in our house but had leave it when we downsized into an apartment This is the countertop model of the one we had to leave behind As the wiseman said I have a happy life when I have a happy wife
Great little microwave Great basic little microwave It is small but it has all the basic functions you need It heats things very thoroughly and quickly Surprised at how much hotter it is than my bigger GE
Could not have asked for anything better Could not have asked for anything better The price was so cheap and the microwave works very well The door is kind of hard to open When I open it with one hand I tend to push the machine a little No issues with heating and seems to work well The sound is kind of loudbut it is a microwave
but still great I should've just read the dimensions A little smaller than I anticipated but still great I should've just read the dimensions better
Good except for the dang Superman door latch Very nice microwave good size programming buttons very clear and easy to use The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the door closure Maybe for some folks having a door that latches so tight you have to hold onto the oven itself when pushing button to open door is a good thing but not for me Really wish there was a way to adjust thisa bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door And one small noteI haven't figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer my old one you could and find that to be a feature I misshave written to Danby to ask if I'm missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond UPDATE Danby took over a week to respond but it's as I fearedyou cannot set timer and still use microwave to cookOH WELL but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave And make sure that when you check a review for Danby microwave it is for the actual model you are looking atAmazon has chosen to lump ALL Danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 11 and 1000 watt some reviews are all the way down to the 7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews
Not small at all Not as expected Measurements are given and are true to what the item itself is Was very surprised at how big this microwave turned out to be Very dissappointed as I thought I would be getting a small microwave This microwave took up just as much space as my current one It will be going back to seller
Works As Advertised If You Do Proper Prep Work Works very well if you properly prepare your old microwave first by degreasing sanding cleaning and taping it off before applying multiple light coats
The oven stopped working 1 month after I got it The oven stopped working 1 month after I got it Samsung is unhelpful a repair guy came said he fixed it It is still not working I have been chasing Samsung for 2 weeks
but it seems like they should be able to fix that in a Tiny as promised Not very powerful which goes with the tiny but it seems like they should be able to fix that in a future model The button to open the door requires a LOT of pressure
I like Sharp Microwaves I like Sharp Microwaves My mother had one for 40 years and I have had one for 30 years before both required repair My microwave needed a new magnetron and fuse which I fixed for $12500 My mother's microwave had to be replaced as we could not find all of the replacement parts we needed Hence I purchased the one above almost an exact replacement It works very well and is easy to use but I am not happy with the outward appearance Too much black and it looks cheap compared to her original one
Four Stars good
Stopped Working After 5 Months It was delivered on Feb 14 2015 and has stopped working already Brand new outlet so I know it's not that Will not turn on at all and the return window closed on Mar 17 2015
Great microwave for small spaces This is a very good microwave it is perfect for places with limited counter space It is small You won't be able to cook full meals with this microwave but it is perfect for basic microwave uses such as heating up frozen vegetables and reheating leftovers So far it has worked just fine
works well and an an advantage i had not thought works well and an an advantage i had not thought of is that the 5 yo can use it with supervision
great for singles i am please with this purchase its the only portable close washer i have purchased so i can't compare products e spin cycle isn't veryeffective but it washes well you can put a pair of man size jeans and a couple of tshirts at one time i purchased a two year protection plan just in case
then it's a great deal i have not used it yet but it looks exactly same size that we have hope it works well then it's a great deal
matched its description successfully replaced broken part on my matched its description successfully replaced broken part on my samsung dishwasher does the job needed which was mostly just to keep the top dishwasher rack in highest position i have used lever to raise and lower but it's just not some thing i need often hard to install had to really press on it using tools before it made an audible snapping sound and settled into place it only goes in one way in a specific place so pay attention because force is required and forceful install in wrong place will destroy it since it is a hard plastic i could see where the plastic mounting tabs showed stress from the install i worried they would break off during my efforts important to know that these are sidespecific you need to buy a right or a left to fit the need because it cannot switch between them when one breaks the others carry the load and break sooner so buy spares ensure your purchase specifies right left or both
if you like cold drinks don't purchase does not keep ice cold if you like cold drinks don't purchase great cool collectable but it functional
Four Stars Good I love it Hoping its lasting My friends and family was excited thought I changed my dishwasher
slides too easily Works well but same gripes as other reviewers no handle slides too easily
Perfect space and size Perfect space and size I have no cabinet space and this works perfectly But you can't put a regular size plate in it Still serves their purpose
Four Stars The push buttons are ok but occasionally have to push harder to operate
Owned since December 15 2014 Overall like it and would recommend One issue is that of late the door requires several pushes to open I've cleaned the area can not see an obvious issue but am concerned that it may worsen So far that is the only negative I've experienced I'm contacting Samsung directly on this one
SOLID microwave looks and works perfect See my photos We love this One of our favorite parts of the kitchen remodel Such a spacesaver and it just IS cool I read some negative reviews all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it? Well duh I have a 5yo and 8yo they know not to stand onin the microwave And it's 2015 who needs a revolving plate? I use a microwave for quick stuff not rotisserie chicken and whatnot We are superpleased with this microwave
Solid Microwave but has got a few consStill recommended for its efficiency I bought this MW for use in an apartment after reading the good reviews on Amazon Functionality and performance and even lookwise this has been a great buy No complaints there But a couple of important downsides to this microwaveIt is LOUD and keeps beeping even after the timer is done there is no 30 second timer which is already mentioned in some of the reviewsQAs So that is a factjust confirming here
Very satisfied This microwave is great The size is perfect for my small studio apartment not a lot of countertop real estate and the stainless steel finish looks really nice Sturdy construction and works very well The light turning on when you open the door is a nice feature I docked it a star because the buttons are a little more difficult to push than other microwaves but not too big of a deal
It used to open easily It no longer opens when you push the I've had the microwave for 2months It used to open easily It no longer opens when you push the button you have to manually pull the door open definitely a disappointment I hope I can return it
Three Stars Not as fun as I thought I would be
 have a small apartment well and I am very pleased Does not take up a lot of room Fits my counter top I have a small apartment well and I am very pleased Does not take up a lot of room and seems to work very efficiently Thank you
Had problems in just 3 months disappointed This microwave worked fine for some 3 months and then started problem with door I was totally disappointed seeing problem in just 3 months Customer service was rude and unhelpful
Five Stars am very happy with this
Five Stars Works the way I expected it to work
Wonderful looking Quite large I didn't measure well and this wonderful piece of equipment was much too large so I had to return it So sorry I'd have loved to keep it
Four Stars My mom really likes it
Nice looking easy to clean and large interior Just as advertised Nice looking easy to clean and large interior  MNo problems thus far
Five Stars Great
Installed easily and looks great Installed easily and looks great It's only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints Fan is quiet
Heats up fast Big enough to put lots of things in but doesn't take up too large of a space on the counter I can say this honestly as I have less than 9 linear feet of countertop available to stick anything onto
Yuk Horrible waiting for a refund
Five Stars good machine
Five Stars great microwave simple and compact
Five Stars Great value for the money
Great Product We opted for this style of microwave this time around in our new kitchen and have not been disappointed The shipping was fast thanks to Amazon the look of the microwave is wonderful and goes well with our other appliances GE Monogram DCS the drawer opens and closes well it cooks wonderfully it's quiet controls are simple to use the kitchen timer is handyI know there were some negative posts but as of now after 4 months of use I couldn't be happier

I works well and I am happy with it It is a cute microwave that fits into the space I had It is a little smaller than I had imagined and the 34crome34 on the outside is a little hard to clean I works well and I am happy with it
Five Stars Great product
Five Stars Powerful and beautiful microwave
Five Stars Very good product for the price
Great Trim Kit Great product looks nice Exactly what we were looking for Arrived in great shape two days after we ordered it
So far she is very happy wit it It is everything I wanted it to be Got it for my 92 year old mother who had a microwave die on her So far she is very happy wit it Time will tell if it is a substantial product but the price was very good
Cheaply put together Very low quality for the amount Cheaply put together Very low quality for the amount of money spent Spend a little more and get a quality product
Excellent value for money He has worked perfectly right out the box It was simple to set up and easy to use I've used it to defrost meat make beverages bake potatoes etc etc and its been great Excellent value for money It lived up to its Consumer Report's Best Buy status
Four Stars Fine product
Perhaps its my fault in not researching the low wattage Perhaps its my fault in not researching the low wattage but indeed this microwave takes an exorbitant amount of time to heat items
One Star Late Package Delivery Damaged Item
Absolutely fine Actually Absolutely fine Actually I recommended it to a friend It was the right size for her She ordered and received from you Fits perfectly for her too I like the handle on the door Makes it easier
Four Stars Wish the cord was longer but I really like the way it fits into the corner of my countertop I have a small kitchen it doesn't take up a lot of space
Nice little Machine Fits in my studio without taking up to much space I have no down side to comment on this little microwave It functions perfectly for what I need it forwhich is heating bowls of isomalt for working hot sugar art Love it
Great buy for the money I looked a long time before I found this microwave it was very hard to find one where the interior light goes on when the door is opened not just when it is in operation This one does is logical to operate and fits nicely on a counter top The only thing on my wish list that is lacking is power it's only 1000 watts and I would have preferred 1200 watts
Great for limited space This is a great little microwave It fits perfectly in my tiny space so that I have a little more needed counter space than I did with my larger microwave
Perfect size for my dinner plates Perfect size for my dinner plates I like the express cook buttons that allow me to hit one button to start cooking Cooking times for store bought frozen foods seems to be just right for this microwave Good quality for a low price
Simple Pretty simple
Four Stars very good
Five Stars works
Great Works as expected Great value
Works great and priced right I am in a wheelchair Cannot stand to reach our over the stove microwave Purchased this to place on he counter Now I can microwave to my hearts content Works great and priced right Would recommend it to everyone
Five Stars Exactly what I wanted
Five Stars Looks great for the price and works well Could not ask for more
Five Stars Product does the job it was sold to do
It's tinny It's kind of tinny Probably just too small The latch for closing the door sticks so you need to slam the it and the whole thing shakes I'm already prepared for itt o die and I will buy a larger and more expensive one
Five Stars love this Good size for countertops had it since January 2015 and loved every minute of it
Good call It came with the diode which may have caused the problem and I would not have known it Good call
Great size I only use a microwave to reheat Great size I only use a microwave to reheat things So nothing more then 5 minutes or so The simple display to add time by 30 second increments is what allows this to be so small If you need complicated time inputs with numbered buttons this isn't for you
Simple but Nice Great value for the price Full array of function controls Takes up small amount of counter space yet has plenty of room for a full 10 1234 dinner plate on its motorized turntable
Very quiet Nice microwave arrived quickly was actually 40 dollars cheaper than in the local big box stores very quiet sleek look Grill function works well so far we've had it only a week but it seems to be doing the job as described
Five Stars TThe kit works well It took lots of work to unload and reload the microwave over the range though
Five Stars It's great
Great stuff Saved me from having to buy new Great stuff Saved me from having to buy new oven It's been a year and it's still good
Great little microwave My over the range microwave died and the manufacturer no longer makes the model I have Because it will take me some time to find what will look correct with what I now have I needed a microwave oven quick Took a chance because I didn't want to spend a lot of money and purchased the Danby 07 cu ft countertop I couldn't be more pleased It works just great for what I need and it arrived in two days
perfect It works nothing fancy no bells and whistles It's small its basic and that's all I needed Big enough to fit a dinner plate and small enough to push into a corner perfect
very nice Fast delivery great microwave
Not snow white but off white color The color description on the can is 34snow white34 the reality is this paint is an off white color My GE microwave is a bright white color and this paint did not match I still used the product and it worked well If the directions are followed the spray applies evenly and covers well with several coats For my needs I liked this product better than the touch up paint with brush application You also get more paint with the spray can
Five Stars Great small size easy to clean Amazing price
Five Stars Very nice little microwave and doesn't take up a ton of space on the counter
pad very delicate The button pad gets very easily torn up I'm not a heavy handed person Owned this a few months and the pad is torn up Looks like something was chewing on it Especially the start and clear buttons Would have spent a bit more for a sturdier pad Otherwise it works great and looks good
Glad I bought it Works well Great small size Easy to figure out controls
Great product for the money Great little unit Only big enough for one dinner plate but does the job well
Great Mircowave The microwave and is nicer then I expected for the price It is stainless steel inside and out they also include a replacement key pad cover the only thing I do not like is the glass turntable did not come with a wheeled undercarriage to allow for smoother rotation but other then that very nice and I would by again
 exactly what I needed to repair my microwave easy install This part was exactly what I needed to repair my microwave easy install
Two Stars it was great The product came as describedon time and the right product
Two Stars Doesn't work on a pure sine wave inverter
Great price shipped in good speedy time Great price shipped in good speedy time a very small dent that we decided we were not going to complain or worry about Oven was mounted and neither of us felt it was worth taking out and starting over Works great convection or micro wave
Nice Fits under my cabinet is pretty quiet I've only used it to heat up things works great Takes up only a small amount of countertop
Danby Delivers Quality and Value Great product really like it and the price was amazing I got in time and it was pack well I would recommend it to others one caveat let's hope it last a few years Martha
A great Canadian product Just the right size Not too bignot too small
Five Stars Good paint to touch up the interior of a microwave
Also the plate that rotates sticks and makes a horribly loud noise as if something is going to explode Arrived in timely fashion and well package My complaints It is noisy when it runs Also the plate that rotates sticks and makes a horribly loud noise as if something is going to explode I worry that this oven may not last long The door also requires a 34hard34 push on the mechanism to open the door l would not purchase this again
Five Stars Part was received on time and works perfectly
Does the job Eventually This thing is small and that's what we needed But it is weak I've used some really awful microwaves before but this thing takes longer to heat my food than any of them It eventually does the job though and the price was right
great value intuitive controls big enough for me easy to use controls great price
just ok I've had this item for about a month It was purchased to replace an aging microconvection that I've had for about 8 years While I've not yet used all the various settings I have used the microwave function More to that in a minute When I received this item the box didn't show any damage but the micro had a sizable dent in the exterior upper back part of one of the side panels Returning the item seemed like a huge pain one of the problems with ordering this type of merchandise from an on line source so I called Amazon customer service and they gave me a credit for the damage On to the performance of the unit It does work well as a microwave however it is louder than any microwave I've ever had in the past including the microconvection that I bought this one to replace Is this a problem associated with the dent in the housing? Perhaps Now the reason I've only used the micro function? I just haven't had the time to dig thru the manual to figure out how to use the other functions It really is not very intuitive when it comes to ease of use Also while I knew that it had a wheel for time adjustment I didn't realize how much I'd gotten use to simply entering the time digitally I know this sounds like a petty complaint but one would think that as technology advances we wouldn't be taking backward steps in product design I'll add more as I have the time to decipher the instructions for more functions
Got it same day as ordered Awesome We are back up and running
very good i event toast bread in it Very very good i event toast bread in it thank you SAMSUMG and AMAZON TOOOOO
could be a bit larger it is a bit small Also the sound it makes when it is done is ear piercing
One Star Love the size but didn't last a month
Five Stars It works fine
I have been very happy with the microwave I have been very happy with the microwave It fits the space I have perfectly and so far has been working well
i hate that opening the door moves the microwave towards you i hate that opening the door moves the microwave towards you and out of its place Thats my only complaint
Just perfect in all ways Exactly what we hoped for in every way After needing to retire our wellloved Advantium we opted to replace it with a morebasic microwave After rewiring from 220 what the Advantium required to regular ol' 110 we bought this GE microwavecombo and had it installed What separates this unit from other combination models? Well for one We can use the timer AND the microwave at the same time Something we kind of took for granted in having had the Advantium for so many yearsNo other microwave seems to have this stupidlybasic feature something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a toprated Sanyo unit And they questioned US when we kvetched about the timeruse of microwave conflict insisting we were asking for too much Right Back to this GE Stainless steel interior is wickedlyeasy to clean the 'beep' tone isn't obnoxious and the heating element cooks evenly Just perfect in all ways Can't say more about it Thanks
Meh Too small and too heavy but works as expected
Five Stars easy to installlooks great
Five Stars Good microwave
for easy storage and use Bigger than I thought but still works well for my needs Fits right under my bed for easy storage and use Definitely a perfect space saver microwave
Fair Deal The Danby microwave works well but it is somewhat flimsy I've only had it for a few months and the plastic coating on the keypad is already bubbling and peeling However the microwave cost less than $50 so for the price it's a fair deal
 been about two months and my husband and I love this microwave It has been about two months and my husband and I love this microwave We have plans of putting it in our new island as a built in It looks great and works really well The convection feature is a huge bonus I would buy again
Compact Microwave Have only had it about a month but so far so good It is smaller than my last one but I needed something that would fit in a small space and it's hard to find compactsized microwaves I just use it for warming up things and it seems to be doing the trick
This Danby model is perfect for that I wanted a small microwave to heat food more than cook it in the first place For example I bake a large casserole in my oven keep it in the fridge then later heat mealsized portions This Danby model is perfect for that Occasionally I'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch or so interior rotating cooking surface One thing to be aware of and that is this is a 700 watt microwave Most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves This means you must cook things longer with 700 watts No problem Do an internet search for 34microwave 700 watt conversion chart34 and you'll see plenty of charts you can print I posted one I printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when I need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt Danby Example 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave This is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power It may no be for everyone However it meets my needs exactly Also it looks and performs well I have had no problems with it I'm a satisfied customer
Five Stars took off rust under turntable with dremel motto then applied three coats ann hour apart VERY HAPPY
Five Stars Love the microwave It works great and adds such style and flare to our kitchen
Can't go wrong with this microwave This model is a newer version of one that we had for many years It fits perfectly in the custom cabinetry that we have It looks great and functions really well We're very happy with this purchase
Five Stars Fantastic love this little bastard Saves my counter space and looks great
Very happy looks great in my kitchen and easy to use Installed easily So far I've baked a chocolate cake and cookies with convection method Both turned out perfect Microwave works as I expected
Dandy unit Everything we wanted in a microwave All black looks better than just black face Has the 30second addon feature which we both like Slides around but that can be remedied with nonslip material Has a nice 34lip34 at bottom so can be clasped while pressing buttons or starting which prevents slipping in the first place Great price for productbut time will tell for sure
Good Quality So far I like this microwave It seems like good quality materials and also well put together It's doing a great job efficiently heating
i would of like more selection in the Exactly what i was looking for i would of like more selection in the color
Will not work in OTR vehicles what a huge waste of money We bought this microwave specifically because it would fit into the little compartment of my husband's OTR truck We've never had issues getting a microwave to work in the truck before and to make matters worse when my husband called their posted phone number for assistance he kept getting passed around from one 'um I don't know' person to the next We would have returned the microwave IF he hadn't already put it in the truck and left from home BEFORE he discovered that it doesn't work on the power source why not we still don't know Looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal We gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it DOES work if you want to use it in a house but for some reason will not work with the power inverter OTR trucks use
Ok but some options are limited and the instructions are somewhat obtuse Works fine but somewhat lacking in some features The defrost selection begins at 12 lbs In a single person household I often need to defrost smaller amounts I buy packages of pork chops vegetables etc and split them up into small packages and freeze them Also my previous microwave had a 30 second time add feature which I used more often than the 1 minute add feature on this microwave One minute is often longer than I need and if 30 seconds is too short I could always push it more than once That microwave also had several fan speeds and light options The lower fan speeds were useful when I didn't need the higher speed and reduced the rather irritating high speed fan noise These restrictions are mostly just somewhat irritating and overall I'm not dissatisfied with the unit I also found the installation instructions somewhat difficult to follow Mainly I had a few parts that didn't seem to go anywhere My previous unit different maker only lasted 4 years which was a disappointment I hope this one lasts longer
Five Stars Everything was perfect
Four Stars Excelent thanks
I'm very happy with this purchase Was drawn to this one after reading all of the positive reviews They were spot on I'm very happy with this purchase
TREMENDOUS HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND BACK DANGEROUS THIS GIVES OFF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK Simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm I then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat Since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous Especially if you have children I am returning it immediately
Five Stars Worked great Looks like a new microwave
Do Not Buy This Microwave This has to be the worst microwave I have ever purchased It arrived without the internal clock it is completely missing so obviously it didn't function out of the box And I can't get a replacement for another week this is awful I know microwaves are just a convenience but having just moved we don't have one and this was timed to arrive just in time for our new home Total disappointment in both the product and Amazon
Five Stars Nice product for the price Delivered quickly
Five Stars Awesome microwave seems much expensive than i paid for it
I need a better finished bottom I did not care for the way the bottom of the microwave was not finished I need a better finished bottom The filter on the bottom does not fit in tightly enough
Fits exactly as the other reviewers measured It fits perfectly under my cabinets the measurements given by everyone are accurate I was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment but it runs with just a small dimming of lights WHEW It heats nicely and is quite spacious The only annoying thing is that startstop are the same button but 34cancel34 is a tiny button near the top of the panel So often I go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again I am used to cancelstop being the same button I'll reprogram myself In the meantime I love it Side note There is a cardboardy thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual LEAVE IT THERE If you go to the manufacturer's website you can find out it's a mica panel to protect a vent It's tempting to toss it because it looks out of place with the rest of the shiny chrome but just leave it
bought along with the GE microwave is just fine Not large enough to fill the gap in Trim kit bought along with the GE microwave is just fine Not large enough to fill the gap in the kitchen cabinets since it is replacing the large size GE Advantium built in microwave Had to get cabinet installer to fill the gaps between the cabinetry and trim kit Looks fine Is perfect if the area you are using it in is the exact same size so watch out for that
Works great Doesn't take up the whole counter Big enough for a plate of food Works great Doesn't take up the whole counter
Three Stars smaller than your average microwave
Very Satisfied Great price 1000 watts Works perfect
I would have given it five stars if there was I would have given it five stars if there was a handle on the door to grab on to so that's why I decided to give four stars
One Star Does not work will be sending back
Four Stars Fit perfect in cupboard nice sleek designeasy to cleanhaven't used the grill part yet but expect I will soon
One Star Missing the turnable shaft Can't use it without this part Will alter feedback once problem is resolved
Not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having Unit defective upon arrival could not be repaired after two attempts and numerous phone calls to Samsung Not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having a microwave for a month after purchase
Five Stars Met my needs
Don't waste you money The only thing it did was cover the spots  When I turned the microwave on it sparked I had waited 24 hours It is a GE mstainless on the out side Wasn't cheap and was a gift Suck it up and buy a new one
Good price great product good Price for good product The price was right and now after some three months of use I've not had any problems with it
Five Stars the paint did a great job would buy again
Five Stars Nice
value for monet I got a good bargain on this Looks good on the countertop Though small in size with limited power It works perfectly well and serves the purpose
Good smaller microwave So far so good I've been using it for about a month it is a smaller size and less oppressive in my small kitchen Intuitive controls No complaints
Very nice small microwave Very nice small microwave Small footprint but still powerful enough Also good for putting it on a higher place like on top of the fridge all the controls are at the bottom part
Turn table motor works well Only problem it Turn table motor works well Only problem it only reverses counter clock wise at random Doesn't automatically reverse direction at every start
Great design Compact and efficient Great design Compact and efficient Easy to use
 cook and reheating and it does both jobs just fine We have only used for quick cook and reheating and it does both jobs just fine
Five Stars Love it Just as described works great
Five Stars e z fix fit perfectly worked great
Awesome on all points Fantastic microwave I bought it to replace a PoS GE micro that failed in less than a year Very powerful very intelligent settings and very attractive
The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm The new model arrived quickly I got a friend to help install it You'll need a friend It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door But if I opened and gently closed the door again it'd turn off It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent Today my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire Checking on the internet it seems that this is not an uncommon problem It's probably not going to be covered by warranty And how do I get it to the manufacturer? They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven If I pay for shpping both ways I might as well buy a new microwave Lessons learned I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose returnservice policy I understand and I will not use an overtherange microwave again
Five Stars Works as advertised
awesome My old microwave is going strong Planned obsolete is no longer going to take me over Paint works great Prep took a while as old paint may not like the new paint and bubble So prep
Five Stars Really nice fit and finish STAINLESS INTERIOR wipes clean GET IT
Fantastic Perfect size And it works great I love it
HAVE HAD THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT A MONTH NICE SIZE AND WORKS VERY WELL AND QUIET SHIPPING WAS HAVE HAD THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT A MONTH NICE SIZE AND WORKS VERY WELL AND QUIET SHIPPING WAS A LITTLE SLOW DUE TO BEING OUT OF STOCK BUT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT MADE HER IN USA FROM WHAT THEY SAY 
Perfect  This is exactly what I was looking for Not too large but will hold a dinner plate Heats food well Love the Express Cook feature simply push 12 ect for however many minutes you want it starts runs till finished Also like the fact display goes back to clock time instead of saying END like my previous one Could not be happier 
Don't waste your money Loved this when I first got it purchased after reading really great reviews However I noticed that the top got really hot and several weeks after purchase it got so hot that it shut itself off This didn't happen again so I kept it until a month and a half after purchase I went to open the door to put a cup of coffee in and the top part of the handle broke saw a piece of plastic shoot across my counter I am returning and getting another brand not going to waste my money on another of these cheap pieces of equipment
It has all the right features It has the 3 things I cared about a light that goes on when you open the door a quick one touch feature 30 seconds plus single minutes and it is the right size and power for my uses
Junk micro and junk seller Absolute piece of junk from an unsavory seller Do not buy this microwave It was refurbished and I didn't know The cord had been 34trimmed34 by the previous owner so it could fit through a hole quite a surprise Didn't come with templates to install had to buy separate Door closes way too hard and noisy And now it's dead one year later I had my previous microwave for 9 years Total junk Wish I could give the microwave zero stars
Looks good works well I just got the microwaves yesterday and will add more when I know more BUT so far it is good I like the look and the ease of use I cannot wait to try the grill feature The grill feature does make it heavier but not too much Also when comparing microwaves remember to look at the wattage as this is a bit lower than some and so cooking times will be a bit longer
Five Stars Works great for the price
perfect for limited counterpane in a small Innovative shape perfect for limited coutnerspace in a small apartment
So far it's been very good It replaced a much larger unit but this is a much better size Different controls of course but they're acceptable The one time I used the dinner plate feature it was spot on The reason I knocked off one star considered two is because the turntable ring and plate dislodge easily if a heavy object is slid across or not centered when setting down
Five Stars I like how it doesn't allow finger prints
Great product Love this microwave Perfect size for our office counter works very well and looks nice
Cord too short The cord isn't long enough so I have to pay more money for a longer cord
nice size Solid nice sizeworking fine so far Good price and quick service
Nice microwave for a good price This is a very nice microwave at a great price I wish it was 1100 watts instead of 1000 That little bit does make a difference The only thing I can say is a slight negative is the noise on start up It is kinda loud But I would definitely recommend this microwave
Five Stars The buttons are hard to push but otherwise it's just what I wanted
Does the Job I like the performance of this microwave It was bought after our other one caught on fire It fits perfectly on the counter in the corner The only problem with it is the button for the door It is very stiff and hard to push I thought it was just me but my husband complained about the same thing It's not enough of a problem for it to be returned
Five Stars Everything as expected Installed the magnetron and diode by following videos on YouTube and everything is now working again
Five Stars Perfect for a countertop
Good cheap microwave Good cheap microwave I was able to tuck this into a cabinet which is great since I do not like a lot of clutter on the counters No complaints Works as expected For what it is a 55 stars
I can't speak to the good qualities it may have I purchased this for a gift and didn't open the box The recipient informed me that it was defective The door wouldn't close I chose to have it repaired locally as it was heavy for me to take to PO Needless to say it discourages me from ordering large objects through Amazon I can't speak to the good qualities it may have I just wish the quality control had been better
love the microwave Perfect fit I went to several appliance stores locally telling me I couldn't get one to fit Love the look and bot microwave and convection wok great
Amana 15 cu ft Over Range Microwave Great product at a good price and easy to install
and it would also be nice if it had one of those buttons to press Had it for a while now so far no malfunctions Decent size I do wish it was a little quieter the beeps are very loud and it would also be nice if it had one of those buttons to press to just add 30 seconds to the current timer count but overall pretty good
Cheap Broke in less then 60 days
Good stuff Entry level small and powerful Was here in 2 days with prime Best way ever to shop Recommend both the microwave and Amazon prime
Not for the Inverter use If you want to use on your truck this is not the one I bought for my fatherinlaw's truck In terms of its size it was perfect fit for the truck with inverter built in but as other people described it's not working properly with the inverter I think it will work normally with normal AC but not through the inverter The inverter was rated as 1500W So $50 inexpensive microwave works better than this one I had to return it 
Very High Value for a Small Kitchen Area Perfect for my needs compactness appearance and performance A very high quality product
You can find better products in the store at lower prices Very small You can find better products in the store at lower prices
Disappointed Looks good only worked a week First timer would work but no heating occurred next dy everything looked like it was good lit up revolving timer working but food temp was not changing Cancelled replacement and have NOT been refunded
Covered well prep was most work One can did the Covered well prep was most work One can did the entire cavity
Great little micro Adorable and it works great Not as powerful as my old one but the added counter space more than makes up for it My covered Corningware fit in it perfectly but my plates don't a standard 1134 plate fits mine are 115 not a big deal for me but if you reheat on plates you should measure them
Five Stars Compact stylish and very efficient Wish it was all stainless steel
First time I've purchased an appliance through Amazon They First time I've purchased an appliance through Amazon They delivered it on it's SIDE for some reason I guess the arrow pointing up was confusing? but it works nonetheless
This microwave is fantastic It fits into the corner of the countertop This microwave is fantastic It fits into the corner of the countertop which I consider the dead space I am unable to reach most things placed in this space but the microwave is perfect I have more counter space I would rate the performance a 15 out of 10 because it's so great
Five Stars As Advertised
microwave It is a fine microwave but I am not that happy with it
Not recommended for anyone who is looking for fast action product Working but you need to set extra time to get your food warm up What I normally warm up in 30 seconds when I had GE microwave oven now takes 1 minutes and 30 seconds to warm I could have return it but I don't want Amazon to tag me as product return guy Not recommended for anyone who is looking for fast action product
Five Stars Good value for money Satisfied
Moderately priced microwave Fits into my cabinet space perfectly glass rotating plate does not shift as my other microwave did A good deal
Great Like it very much heats evenly and easy to use
Five Stars very good works great
Doesn't work I loved the price on this microwave So did my 90 year I'll grandfather We bought it and he was excited to have back the way he can cook most of his meals Sadly though half of the button do not work He can not set the clock or defrost I offered to try and return it but he needs it to cook and it can do that I guess But I don't recommend this product at all
big and bigger Very large and over priced What happened to the small cube microwave?
Broke after barely any use It quit working one month after the date I could return it I had been out of town for 6 weeks after I bought it so it was barely used
Five Stars Very nice and useful product
Five Stars Got it quickly it works great
One Star Terrible product broke down after one month of light use
Five Stars It is just the right size it doesn't crowd the space
good for the price For its price it's a good little microwave It does slide when I try to open it since it's very lightweight and doesn't have any rubber feet The inside is smaller than I'm used to but I knew that when I purchased it I was looking for small to fit in a smaller space I don't use it to really cook only reheat so it totally meets my needs I only gave it 4 stars because it slides across the counter when I open the door Hopefully I can add some rubber feet to stop this
Stylish but not reliable poor customer service as experienced by many others Several Samsung appliances looked interesting featuresappearances when we were upgrading our appliances Then I found a problem after diving into the customer reviews the overall ratings are good but for customers who give them low rates have catastrophic failures eg smoking induction ranges more than other brands We decided to stay away from Samsung brand for our major purchases As we got most of our appliances sorted out we still need a microwave This one again looked interesting I thought ok how bad can it be? Its neither too heavy nor too expensive let's take a risk on this one But I was wrong Long story short after one month the turntable starts to make noise After 3 repair attempts over several weeks we were left with the turntable not turning at all To add to the insult these 3 repair attempts don't even register in Samsung's system so even if the lemon law is more and more applicable to my case I would have trouble claiming it Based what I found after taking apart of our broken Samsung TV I think the company put too much emphasis on using their own components and some of them are not very good That could be why we are seeing a pattern of reliability problems across its product lines
Perfect for me I love this little microwave I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome however after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space After coming across this one I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons 1 What if it was actually TOO small? 2 It didn't have the crazy power of my last one I'm impatient Alas I bit the bullet have been VERY happy with it ever since I've realized that I never actually cook dishes in the microwave totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers making popcorn heating up water etc I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day now it's no big deal at all I usually just press the start button a few times getting the time up to whatever I want it to be let it go I would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as I as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen
Short Lived Was extremely happy with the performance of this oven while it worked however after only 4 months of moderate usage it stopped working completely it made a loud droning sound followed by the smell of electrical burning and then would no longer would heat up anything I would also note that the mechanism to open the door is annoying it is located under the control panel and it would be better to have it on the door handle
good quality Arrived in well conditon good quality product
Five Stars it works
Very low quality We have had this microwave for 2 months It makes the scariest noises like there is metal in it but there is not The plate also does not spin properly Very low quality Go with a brand you trust
I love it However I had to return it and Repair I love it However I had to return it and Repair my old one as the DOOR Hinge did not Allow for flush placement on Left side as its in a RV and thats the way RV MFG installed it
Great Microwave for a Super Price We love our new microwave I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this machine It works great and was delivered speedily Thank you Danby for an affordable microwave that really works well
Very good paint II had the same problem that many people do with the GE Cafeacute microwave The paint was peeling off after a couple of years and GE would not stand behind their product so I bought this paint and masked off the interior's good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats Sprayed really nicely covered well not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long Dried quickly minimum odor nice sheen looks like new This was a good fix although I think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but I'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years The product came quickly and I was very happy I would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect
Three Stars there were some issues about the exact measurements other than that it fit well
Nice looking microwave Nice looking microwave basic features no 30 seconds key but no big deal The only complaint that I have is after it finishes it will constantly beep until you open the door or hit any key otherwise it will keep beeping 3 times forever every 30 seconds
Works great Better than what's available at Sears works great easy installation I didn't like the black center as it doesn't match our kitchen but for the price I'm living with it
mositure gets trapped and cause bad smell Microwave functions as expexted but the inside smells bad I think it's because the steam from food gets 'trapped' inside After some use I can see that the door has moisture droplets I think this is what cause the bad smell My old microwave of ten years never had this problem With this one I have to leave the door open after use and have to clean the inside frequently I didnt have to do any of these for my old one Will not recommend this microwave
Five Stars This kit fixed my microwave and it arrived before the weekend
Excellent Excellent microwave and excellent convection oven combined in one compact unit
great appliance Works great not loud at all and small enough for my small kitchen Affordable price and shipping was fast
Ok but little Really short from top to bottom lots will not fit That is probably my fault measurements are probably in the description But the glass round tray comes out every time we use it and it very hard to put back in to rotate properly
Five Stars Worked perfectly No issues and fast shipping
but it delivered good results i think it met and exceeded my expectationYou need atleast 2 to paint the entire microwave 2 layerI am new to this but it delivered good resultsThanks
Nice size My niece was thrilled with the microwave being delivered to her door Nice sizeworks great
Maybe I got a lemon The microwave did a good job of heating but had enough problems that I sent it back after 4 days 1 It blew the circuit breaker which had held up to other microwaves of similar power for years 2 When starting it made a worrisome bumping noise 3 The spindle rotating the plate often made a grinding sound Amazon UPS get 5 stars for making it easy to return
Great Appliance We bought this unit for a remodeled high end kitchen I has been installed for approximately six months and we are extremely happy with our purchase No issues whatsoever I love the easy automatic openclose feature and not having to bend down to put items in the microwave The unit holds much larger plates and platters than I was able to put in my former microwave which is really nice It also has many useful features such as a sensor that can tell how much an item needs to be heated to be ready As this was part of a kitchen remodel I simply told the product number to our kitchen cabinet company and they made the cabinets such that it would fit in perfectly as a built in The item fits in well with our suite of other stainless steel appliances No complaints I highly recommend
Fantastic Microwave Fabulous oven great price so easy to use Really glad I found this have the 44 cu ft all refrigerator on it's way too
Works great Sorry for the delay Works great Sorry for the delay I just got my microwave working today 22515 I was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode causing the problem but since the magnetron in my oven was 10 years old I figured that might be the problem However after installing the new kit my General Electric JEM31WA 002 was still not functioning So I ordered new door switches and after checking my old oven switches I learned that the 34bottom34 Normally open door switch was not functioning So I changed it out and 34voila34 my microwave is functioning perfectly It took some time but it is worth it I don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode as my old ones were probably on their way out anyway I had not troubleshot the old magnetron tube If they are still in working order perhaps I can use them again later My most gracious thanks go out to Martin Microwave Inc and Amazon PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL INDEED
One Star Very small and very low power Takes forever to heat anything up
Very nice microwave I only use it to reheat things Very nice microwave I only use it to reheat things SIze is nice does not take up much counterspace
Cute affordable and durable just weaker wattage Cute affordable and durable just weaker wattage than any microwave I've used Also doesn't fit a standard size dinner plate
The machine is attractive and is performing within the range The machine is attractive and is performing within the range of all advertised claims and meets expectations The control logic is intuitive and practical
Great for microwave purposes Great for microwave purposes looks great and easy to clean Grilling didn't seem to work well as shown Maybe practice makes purpose Dont throw away the instructions if you want to try other cooking methods
Noisy and hard to open but I needed a smaller Noisy and hard to open but I needed a smaller microwave with a somewhat higher wattage The wattage isn't quite what is advertised but okay
The largest smallest microwave Really great microwave Since living in an apartment in NYC meant small kitchen space we needed something to fit accordingly This microwave was the largest smallest microwave Perfect for our usage simple functional and good value This microwave is rather quiet love that the beeping noise ends after a few distinct beeps My old microwaves beeps forever Easy setup easy usage and easy clean up
Great for small kitchens Love this microwave I have limited space in my kitchen it slides perfectly in the corner
Do not purchase Try a different brand I bought this in August and it shorted out in February It was nice while it lasted but has a dangerous flaw Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
Five Stars one of the best microwaves I ever had
Adequate for intended use Larger footprint than expected for such a small microwave Appears to be functional enough
I love this microwave I love this microwave I only require quick reheating or a baked potato every once in awhile It's the perfect size
Five Stars Love my new microwave It looks great and works great too Love not having the microwave on the counter
Five Stars Great service very good for a small and compact microwave Very reasonable price
Amazing for the price Heats fast Reliable Amazing for the price
Good quality product and good price Good quality product and good price The button to open microwave door is very hard to push I'm sure it will get easier with use
Looks 100% better in person and much bigger Delivery was on time the microwave look great more better then the picture and very good size very happy with this microwave
Didn't work I got the product out of the box and it doesn't work It will do everything but heat up inside I need to ship it back but between work and school there's no time I will just ask for my money back
it probably works better than the Oster OGB8902B0 I never got this item even though I examined it and placed and order for it of wehich I cancelled it probably works better than the Oster OGB8902B09 That I got instead but has electronic problems
Five Stars Good product stainless inside is easy to clean with rounded corners Designed well
Three Stars Good value for basic microwave
A bit noisy when running and the box and unit A bit noisy when running and the box and unit was damaged in shipping though not affecting functioning Holding up well at the moment
Item arrived damaged At that point return of item Item arrived damaged At that point return of item became a issue
Five Stars Very simple to operate for my grandmother
Saves buying a new microwave Looks good and seems to be holding up a couple of months later
Great Buy I gotta say This microwave looks slick in my kitchen Nice LED display Sleek metal Samsung look Goes nice with my new Samsung Washer and Dryer set Also works great and the controls are laid out intuitively
Five Stars Decent size and good finishing Works great
MORE THAN A COSMETIC PAINT I had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed A couple of coats of this paint saved the day It has a use that is far more than cosmetic It saved me about $175 because I did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because I did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly
Four Stars Good unit but a rough sound when operating
Wonderful finish Glad I made the purchase and saved myself from buying a new microwave WOW my microwave looks like new This paint is very high quality and covers very well I needed only 1 coat but did 3 coats just to use up the can because if I ever need to paint this old thing again its probably gonna be time for replacement
Excellent microwave We had very limited counter top space Excellent microwave We had very limited counter top space and didn't want to take up a lot of that precious space with a fullsize microwave oven This product fit the bill perfectly It's been working great for several months now no complaints at all
Never again Arrived Damaged and needed to use immediately
Meh This microwave is whatever It heats up your food but that's about all it has going for it The bottom three numbers don't work They never have since I bought it Also the paint is already chipping on the bottom inside It's really compact though so it's a good choice if you have limited counter space
Custom Looking BuiltIn Microwave That Works Great I purchased this drawer microwave from Amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home My wife couldn't understand why I wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn't think the whole 34drawer thing34 was a good idea She eventually reluctantly agreed because she didn't want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design Once it was installed she said she liked the looks of it built into the island Everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it's kind of unique When my wife used it the first time I don't think she wanted to admit I actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it's easy to get cookware in and out since it's waist high with the door open My adult son used the 34sensor reheat34 button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat The feature evidently 34senses34 the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it's ready Pretty cool feature I love the microwave It adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great I think my wife even smiled one time when she used it
The microwaveoven features are great Very easy to use and looks great Steel case was damaged on back side Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful The microwaveoven features are great Very easy to use and looks great
UPDATE Danby died taking electrical plug with it Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily???????? I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the 34open34 bar enough to get the thing open the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in  UPDATE March 6 2015  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review the nonslip sits unopened Instead the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box the Danby managed to screw it up After unplugging the Danby and waiting I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave To use this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door Then adjust turntable so it would turn Then add some more time with the 30second add button Then punch it again to open the door Meanwhile from the punching the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time Instead that starts 34express34 time of minutes for the number I touched
Five Stars Finally a microwave that doesn't beep Included 34Crusty Plate34 was badly bent
Door Falls Apart Lasted 2 years and then fell apart The tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own LG does not care since it is out of warranty They want to charge me over $100 for a new door
It arrived in perfect shape and I just had to plug it in It arrived in perfect shape and I just had to plug it in I have been using it every day even though I have an over the stove one too It is so handy to do small jobs along with the big one
Petite microwave Perfect fit in my tiny kitchen Love the cool blue digital readout
Don't buy GE microwav Terrible product Cheaply made Horrible review all around
He likes it I bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away He says he's very happy with it and that's all I need to know
save $ 2 months no problems
rather large for a countertop but otherwise a good product The Samsung Counter Top Grill Microwave contains a lot of features including a softenmelt setting and a grill capability but is probably too large for most countertops an obvious drawback considering what it is advertised to be for However after using this microwave I can say that it works well and while some its components are plastic it seems pretty well constructed to me The grilling feature the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the softenmelt feature are nice I tried the softenmelt feature for example and it worked fine I also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem The only real problem I can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops If this is not a problem for you then I recommend this microwave otherwise I recommend looking for a smaller microwave
Would like to have an add 30 sec or quick minute Works well Would like to have an add 30 sec or quick minute option but overall is very solid for the price
Five Stars works very well
Space saver high wattage several different install options Over the range microwaves are a wonderful way to save counter space This one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work or back into the kitchen and fit under my standard height cabinets very well Be advised that this requires a 20 amp GFI outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove This isn't hard to work out because chances are in a newer house your existing vent hood has electrical for it's fan and light Watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine
Really nice microwave that also grills and functions like an oven My husband has been using this for the past month in his high school classroom and his students have been using it every day to warm things up It's already been getting a lot of use and is holding up great so far Of course I know it hasn't been used that long so I'll be sure to update my review as they use it more The nicest features of this are  It's a microwave that also grills and crisps food so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave It comes with a grill rack and you can cook meat on it When you use the grill function you can put metal into the microwave  but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper The gill function works fine but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked  The 1000 watts make this pretty powerful It's good at evenly cooking food and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button so you can easily add more time to your cooking time  A standard variety of preset buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn veggies and potatoes  The exterior has a scratchresistant coating and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does The measurements on the 11 cubic foot microwave are 111116 H by 2038 W by 151316 D in inches Overall this is a really nice microwave As I mentioned at the start of my review I will update this as my husband and his students use this more but so far they've really liked it and it's held up well to constant use
Shrunk in shipment WOW am I ever surprised The product descriptions states 34Spacious 20 cu ft interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items34 this spacious interior is in reality 14 cubic feet LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid Well so much for honesty in advertising I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped
Great value Quality Merchandise Great value
Sticks out a little too far but works fine Works great looks good but sticks out from cabinets I had it installed and they had no problems what so ever
 it installed for a few weeks now and works fine It's a microwave Had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine It's a microwave You plug it in Fan speeds are great First time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy
I know you get what you pay for in I know you get what you pay for in most cases but in this case I don't feel I did I expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt but it takes at least twice as long The turn table rattles and because of it's light weight you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right otherwise you will push it across the counter Very displeased
Presets are a bit off but it is pretty convenient to have this is a fabulous microwave It does both jobs of a regular microwave and a toaster oven What more could you ask for Presets are a bit off but it is pretty convenient to have You can grill in this as well though I haven't tried it yet I'll keep you posted I would recommend this product to others
Five Stars perfect for my application
Lasted a long time This replaced a 12 year old identical model that finally quit While I considered a more recent model the convenience of installing a microwave with the exact same dimensions and mounting hardware is hard to beat There are a lot of buttons that I will probably never use
It's Big The first thing you should know about this microwave is that it is bigso make sure you have adequate counter space to accommodate it I only use it for simple things like heating things up quicky For this it works well I haven't yet tried its grilling feature
A microwave for those who want to cook more than just popcorn TV Dinners and quesadillas Samsung Countertop Microwave 11 Cubic Feet Stainless Steel is a must buy for people who enjoy cooking meals in their microwaves instead of just zapping snacks and melting cheese The counter top microwave is larger than most models and this one can cook main course meals and side dishes for you and your family A medium sized pizza can be cooked inside it's designed to 34crisp34 instead of being kind of on the soft side like other microwaves Just press the easytouse preset buttons for all of your cooking needs and if you want to 34grill34 your food with the grill layer that works similar to the one found in a convection oven but don't expect the same results Overall I have to recommend this microwave for those who prefer to cook their meals the fast and easy way instead of using a cumbersome stove or for apartment dwellers You can't go wrong with a Samsung Countertop Microwave 11 Cubic Feet Stainless Steel especially if the price is right
Do you really need to grill in your microwave? This is a powerful and great looking counter top microwave It's replaced my old 1000 watt sanyo It has some features you don't find on many microwaves including a power saving mode which turns off the LED clock a grilling element on the top and ceramic plate In theory you could cook a pizza heat up some bacon all while retaining the crispiness I'd probably heat up frozen egg rolls before i do the any of the prior though The grilling feature is gimmicky to me First you lose height for reheating taller items And I'm not one for having an issue using the oven for a frozen pizza or a pan for your bacon Maybe even a toaster oven if you wanna reheat those chicken mcnuggets There's also one more minor issue The rotating glass plate is raised a bit too high around the edges than i'm used to So make sure you lift your item high enough to clear the glass plate when taking anything out
Excellent color match Works exactly as advertised in my GE Profile microwave Color match is darned near exact I prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible Then sprayed in many coats to get coverage I removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips¡ªcould just as easily remove a star from the painter me The paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth Nonetheless I will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the GE oven Cleans nicely and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago 1 can will likely cover about ? of a microwave interior adequately Since my oven was flaking I needed about this much coverage or slightly less If I had stripped the entire interior I would have been short
The Kitchen of the FutureToday I've had this a relatively short time so my review is subject to update the controls require a little reading to understand but other than that this is like something from the kitchen of the future The automatic pop out pop in is smooth and quiet The power is sufficient to get the job done quickly and the microwaves are dispersed so there are no hot spots
Fixed the Turntable Solved the problem Easy to remove and install just like the video shows
Five Stars Great item Works well
Really tiny Not very powerful Both of those Really tiny Not very powerful Both of those were to be expected
It is a great little machine First I want to say I have no issue with the microwave It is a great little machine The turntable is nice and not usual for small and low powered microwave My issue is with the price though It is not worth over $50 even that would be too high It is almost more worth it to find a cheaper one directly from Wal'mart etc
Dangerous Design Problem Fire Hazard Lasted 1 12 years Flimsy cardboard inlet cover on the left side of microwave naturally absorbed some food during use Now this cardboard has somewhat deteriorated the machine is simply a very large fire hazard Catches fire immediately Not safe terrible design
Satisfactory Very basic works fine a little noisier than I like both mechanically and the door and is a great price for what you are getting For instance the microwave I am replacing cost about $800 I wouldn't say the same negatives on that one but it cost 8X as much This one is a good deal if you aren't looking for topoftheline
Nuff Said I bought it I got it I tried it I returned it 'Nuff said Seriously it doesn't appear to be a lasting product
Five Stars Great Product Fast Shipment
NOT a simple 1touch as advertised This is NOT a one touch simple to use microwave as advertised I bought it because many reviewers stated that the startstop button was also an 34add 30 seconds34 button IT IS NOT Even the picture buttons are not easy First you have to push one of them then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button That is 3touch not 1 I bought this for my parents in their nineties No way they can use this It's going back PS The inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean
Five Stars great suction not noisy
Worked as advertised Worked as advertised Like the other reviews preparation is the key First I cleaned the microwave thoroughly Next I taped off all the areas I did not want painted I took the microwave outside and placed on a bench I sanded down all the loose paint and rust with a sanding stone I sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry I probably sprayed 20 coats You could smell the new paint for a couple of days It has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping Good product
Worth the extra price Great microwave It is much more expensive than the typical small microwave but is worth it for something of better quality and at least some elegance of design Controls are simple and light to the touch I don't miss having a numeric keypad
OKAY heats well interior vapors accumulate easily Doesn't clean well and retains odorbut it heats very well Vapors accumulate on all interior surfaces door panel interior housing This may account for the retention of odor Worth a try as microwaves go for general light to medium use
Good looking silent and functional I bought Danby Designer 11 cuft microwave to replace my aging and faulty Sharp Carousal which served well for 7 years On comparing against my Sharp unit I found this few pounds lighter But the marked difference which was noticed is the noise level While Sharp was really a rowdy teenager this guy is really a silent one When measured with smartphone sound meter app the operational level was about 65dB which is like normal conversational level I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue As for functions besides the common controls like popcornpizzabeverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter There is a two step cooking which essentially step down the power for the second round yet to try this feature Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial The wheeled base where the tray rest and the spoke on which tray slots fits looks a bit fragile probably because of the lack of finish on the molds Overall this is a very elegant and industrial looking microwave and so far a great addition to my counter top
Beware Do not buy this You would get better value by throwing money out into the street Mine lasted three weeks and then became entirely useless If you buy one of these and pay for it you will end up with no money and no microwave
Not english I cannot read Not english I cannot read
Five Stars great space saver
THE WORLD'S MOST MISUNDERSTOOD KITCHEN APPLIANCE? I've written quite a few product reviews in the past but never have I seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges Samsung or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is has only added to the confusion unfortunately First a few points to set the record straight The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel There may be a bit of it in the trim but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person Most of the outside has a black textured metal finish which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction which is limited to the trim 34open button34 and part of the door latch I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance In fact the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode which is not true The rack can be used in the combination grillmicrowave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames From the manual page 11 34Grill Rack to be placed on the turntable The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking34 It will even 34work34 in the microwaveonly setting although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all In fact the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place This brings me to the main point of my review Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison Is it heavier than most standalone microwaves? Of course it is because it has an entirely separate heating element electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta pizza crusts etc The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than standalone microwaves which is entirely understandable to me This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavyduty microwaves If used with the grill though it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of standalone microwaves on the market The reason for this is pretty simple To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance Without the heavyduty which is necessarily heavy inside and outside finishes the device has it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage the reasons all boil down to safety You can only add so much shielding to keep the size and cost of such an appliance practical I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does In regards to cost I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks At one point I believe it was $179 shipping included Then it went up to $230 shipping NOT included Today it is down to $19999 with free shipping I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries it seems like at bargain to me For me personally this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen ever It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone actually All in all I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though because it is definitely more expensive than a standalone microwave If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point In any event I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here Try it for yourself and I would bet that you won't be disappointedn to $19999 with free shipping I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries it seems like at bargain to me For me personally this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen ever It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone actually All in all I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though because it is definitely more expensive than a standalone microwave If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point In any event I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here Try it for yourself and I would bet that you won't be disappointed
Includes Toaster Grill As far as microwave cookers go this beats everything else because it includes a toaster grill I really prefer using the toaster grill rather than the microwave even if it takes much longer to cook so it's perfect for me This unit looks really slick and it's so easy to use Very intuitive It's about twice the price of other units but this is a high quality Samsung product I love it HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
A MultiFunction Unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect The preheat setting is problematic to say the least I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility That said the unit is not without issues The short story is the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit The grill function is great provided you use the pan that comes with the unit The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit FIRE The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made Now for those who are interested the long story Microwave Works just great seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit Grill Love this feature I made the following Grilled Cheese upper rack and pan 7 minutes with flip at half way point turned out beautifully Open face bagel with cheese upper rack and pan 5 minutes grilled to perfection Convection Oven I had pretty good but not perfect results here Baked Russet Potatoes medium were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper the paper caught fire I checked the manual about using parchment paper I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking and there was no warning about using it but I can tell you it is a big nono Preheat Function Well this function is pretty worthless on my unit I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up The next time we used it it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down It completely turns off including the time display and will not work at all The next time I let it cycle through both the preheat and 10 minute cycle the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook the unit shut down again As I said we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey sometimes the unit remains functional sometimes it shuts down The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use Slim Fry We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries Overall this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units toaster ovenconvection oven have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs regular oven on this unit and you should be fine For the price the unit seems a solid investment my only reservation being the preheat function which I think I will just chose to not use going forward Recommended with above reservations
Great microwave We needed a new microwave and after reading the reviews bought this one Great microwave Easy to use Fits in the corner perfectly Great for thawing reheating and light cooking Really saves space Makes great popcorn too
Five Stars Color matched great easy repair
Great So Far We've had the microwave for only a few months The door design is similar to our last microwave that lasted only two years We chose this brand because they seem to make a superior product So far it heats well it's easy to clean and has had no problems
Microwave Oven Handle attachment breaks off magnetron fails just a terrible product The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door For my unit the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw Even if I get a replacement door I expect it will break again in six months Avoid this model design Updated Dec 2016 Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem Worse The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up Would not heat food We had a service call and replaced it It has failed again in 9 months LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost I would avoid LG microwaves completely I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years unfortunately LG does not know microwaves 
Five Stars Works great
This Combination Microwave Is Worth the Extra Cost Is a combination microwave oven worth the extra cost? This SAMSUNG COUNTER TOP GRILL MICROWAVE certainly is I've used the 34combi34 button 30% microwave power combined with a singletemperature top heating element along with the 34crusty plate34 and grill rack to cook bacon hamburgers and frozen hamburgers All came out tasting like grilled meats not microwaved meats The regular microwave features work like any standard microwave The interior is easy to clean The microwave door is a mirror that takes a little getting used to see the attached photo The only thing I don't like about this appliance is that the mirrored door won't allow you to watch your food while it's cooking This is a beautiful kitchen appliance that performs the function of both a microwave and a toaster oven But everything cooks with the speed of a microwave At 950 watts the microwave is a little less powerful than my old 1000watt Sears microwave so I need to set it for slightly longer cooking and reheating times Cleaning Tip If you grill bacon you'll get grease splatter on the roof of the microwave Bon Ami removes this easily without scratching the interior
Get crispy food in your microwave We live out in the country where we are forced to use propane for heat and we have a gaspowered oven so we usually don't make pizza at home due to the cost of propane and most pizzas are too large to fit into our toaster oven Additionally when it's hot outside cooking something in the oven turns our whole house into an inferno so we live out of the microwave Being able to cook a frozen pizza and have it be crispy from the microwave is so nice It doesn't seem to ever get to the point where it gets it as crispy as I'd like it but I do like just about everything burned to a crisp I'm odd that way Because of the grill element on the top there is not as much height clearance as we had in our previous model but for the vast majority of things we cook this is not an issue The stainless steel finish is a nice modern update to our kitchen This model has a lot of power for a compact unit
Hot on the Outside Cold in the Middle Perhaps I just got a bum microwave but everything comes out hot on the outside and cold in the middle And there's no sensor cook like the Panasonic microwaves so choosing the 34frozen vegetable34 settings cooks the vegetables for 35 minutes at 60% which is less than a third what it actually needs I got this to replace a faulty Panasonic since Panasonic customer service was TERRIBLE but I'm going back to Panasonic
Five Stars Great microwave for my home
Five Stars Great
Does What It Should I'm not a 'cook everything every meal' kind of girl but we do use it quite a bit for side dishes This Samsung Counter Top Microwave seems like a nice starter microwave It's not incredibly large but for one person it works fine There are a number of preset cook options that could come in handy We tested this on the frozen dinner setting The frozen dinner box was supposed to cook for a shorter time period than the microwave's preset but only by a small amount The cook was even and overall it tasted good As far as looks go this is a sleek little microwave It seems to get dirty easily though especially the button used to open the door It's not too loud while cooking though which is a plus Overall this does what it should and has plenty of bells and whistles for those who use their microwave as their jack of all trades
Five Stars Works perfectly
Spend more to get something you know and trust Kind of weak and weird It is from France and i worry it may wig out because it flashes
Four Stars Saved me the purchase of a new microwave Can't argue with that
Takes your chef skills down a few notches I¡¯m always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multifunction baking broiling microwave convection oven through its paces is that it really does everything very very well Because the interface is not intuitive more on this in a moment you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to You will also have to extrapolate a little bit because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method Still by keeping the manual handy I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried everything except broiling ¨C which looks like it would be quite messy I started simple with the microwave While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally selfexplanatory just choose a setting or power level and cook time this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food the weight what you are trying to accomplish heat defrost etc and it calculates everything for you and runs it Now this sounds like a lot of tedious work and in fact it is But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice In a regular microwave I usually just put it in at high level for a minute stir it up and I end up with a sometimes mushy sometimes not sometimes cold or cool or hot sometimes perfect sometimes inedible bowl of rice Using the bread setting on the Samsung I put the rice in pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions and I ended up with perfectly defrosted not hot not cold not a grain neglected bowl of rice It was in a word amazing defrosted without even getting hot Wow The microwave continued to impress in this fashion popping popcorn defrosting frozen berries warming cold bread all to perfection For baking or actual heating again following the instructions of the manual I made a number of excellent dishes What I failed to notice however was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven That is to say before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact until you push the start button the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious this didn't matter for the most part until I tried the slim fry function Now I have experience with these so called ¡°oilless¡± fryers which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode So I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep but before I did that I started on the potatoes The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes Eight minutes later I was ready to go but the oven was still fast ? preheating I cut to the chase put in my potatoes on the crisper tray set it on the small rack that came with the oven is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack? selected my quantity and hit start The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes Wait 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald¡¯s order fries sit in the parking lot and eat them go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I¡¯d still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung We had a fryless dinner and slim fries admittedly delicious crispy and light fries for dessert I don¡¯t know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints It¡¯s part of the task after all There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows So if you ask me how exactly is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung I have to answer honestly I have no clue Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions and kept notes along the way you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven But as it is I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave but with the quirky implements requiredreading manual and the ¡°we¡¯ll let you know when it will be done when we¡¯re ready to let you know¡± feature it is impossible to rate this any higher than three starse even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows So if you ask me how exactly is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung I have to answer honestly I have no clue Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions and kept notes along the way you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven But as it is I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave but with the quirky implements requiredreading manual and the ¡°we¡¯ll let you know when it will be done when we¡¯re ready to let you know¡± feature it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars
Five Stars Great piece of cooking equipment All as dedscribed
Exceeds expectations Setting it up it is the only issue It is very specifically for countertop use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave Expect to need an extension cord The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average but not much It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened which may be a problem for larger dishes but I've yet to encounter an issue There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen and does so in all four modes microwave convection oven air fryer and toaster ovengrill There is no timer which I found odd but I've been using the phone for that for so long I barely notice The settings make it super easy to use You can autoreheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature There is a convenient popcorn button I've heard stories of a friend without that feature trying to pop up a bag of microwave popcorn Six people One microwave No viable popcorn No such problem here One button and let it pop There are also autocook features for pasta beverage chicken breast frozen breakfast and frozen dinner What? No frozen lunch? The air fry or slim fry however you want to call it feature worked well for me though I only tried homemade french fries It only works for this list of preprogrammed items Frozen oven chips aka french fries Frozen breaded prawns Frozen chicken nuggets Frozen potato croquettes Frozen onion rings Chicken wings Homemade french fries there is a recipe in the guide and it's good to read it first if you've never air fried these before Potato wedges Drumsticks For using it as a toaster oven or grill it seems like they use the terms interchangeably you put the thing you want to toastgrill on the high rack included as is the lower rack and select grill For medium dark toast I go three minutes on each side It comes it shockingly good same as from any toaster I had low expectations for that one but it worked really well Overall it does everything it says it does and it does it very well
The TV in my kitchen This thing is awesome It looks just like a TV which cracks me up It's a bit smaller than most microwaves in terms of counterspace but also a bit taller It has no number pad for entering a specific cook time instead you just hit the start button multiple times to add 30 seconds It is powerful and simple No complaints
It doe's a great job on popcorn though It's noisy You can end up pushing it off the table before the door release works I have to use two hands to open the door one to hold it from moving while I push the door release with the other The plastic printed button cover is already starting to show signs of ware after only a few weeks of use The buttons are hard to locate the center of and actually operate It doe's a great job on popcorn though
Five Stars Perfect fit
Five Stars Excellent product and service
Really like the microwave a bit torn on the other features First off my family and I are very happy with the microwave portion of the Samsung Counter Top Convection Microwave It looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances The black ceramic interior is also a nice touch looks great and should be easy to clean The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced and in operation the microwave is very quiet One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range However it is sufficient for home cooking tasks Setting the power and time is easy The other function we've tried is the convection oven We used it to cook some frozen hors d'oeuvres fancy name for pigs in a blanket using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate Even though we preheated the oven as directed we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven In addition the exterior of the unit becomes very hot when using this mode I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often though it is a nice feature to have As for the Slim Fry grilling combined cooking modes I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will These modes seem to use both microwave and convection heating but it isn't clear how much of each from the very short included manual It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used Even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that Samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject In any event I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying As for grilling the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven and I'm not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking three stars for convection cooking and two stars for the other functions Four stars overall since it does its main job very wellh the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven  So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking three stars for convection cooking and two stars for the other functions Four stars overall since it does its main job very well
Five Stars good
High Quality Large This is a lovely oven also a microwave I have used this for a variety of purposes as an adjunct to my regular oven and microwave I would suggest this as an excellent choice for a counter top oven and microwave but make sure that you have the counter space This is quite large and the venting in the rear requires some space I could not put it in a special shelf for the microwave I had because of the venting For that reason I would give this 45 stars as it is not nimble and is a counter hog
Three Stars It works fine but can get pretty hot
Five Stars Beautiful
A microwave that does not heat Microwave looked nice but did not heat It seemed like a fan was only blowing cold air Amazon has great return policy however and it made the unfortunate buy easily reversed
It comes with metal racks? What next? A TV without a dial? To address the leading question Yes metal racks That work during the use of the microwave function And the universe does not condense into a singularity and explode What else from my childhood has changed? Do you no longer have to turn the dial on a phone to make a call? Drop a dime in the slot to call someone from a payphone? Anyway yes there are metal racks for the microwave and the other function Follow the instructions Here's the skinny This is more than just a microwave You can see in the description all of the functionsand they all work pretty close to as they are described That's the first real issue with the 34Smart Oven34 as the box labels it the descriptions on the webpage here? They're almost as complete as the instruction manual There's a bit more but overall I would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it Especially with the conceptscooking types involved I think the SlimFry concept is great but I'd like to understand how it's working better so that I can do more than chicken wings and fries You will also note several comments on the lack of timer It's true no 34noncooking timer34 In exchange though you can actually generate a crispy crust on that microwave pizza The dropdown door is nice but keep it in mind as you handle placement On a countertop it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave Functionally I'd like a better option when using the grill or SlimFry settings than letting the greasefood drippings to just drop down onto the turntable Especially because that thing gets wicked hot as is reasonable so you have to wait a while to pull it and clean it But the functions work well so that's the main thing In allgreat oven Not perfect but I've never met a perfect microwave
Three Stars Not really a good product Sometimes turns off itself
Love the compact size Love the compact size Hate the fact that the turntable keeps slipping off the base You have to readjust it every single time you use it
Excellent quality and value Works great
Awesome Convection Microwave Oven Before this microwave found its place on my counter this week I hadn't known how much I would love it It heats food quickly is easy to use once you review the manual and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do What makes this microwave different + It has many possibilities + Pizza is crispy on the bottom when reheated even on the microwave setting + It can be simple or you can dive into all the stuff it can do + The size is comparable to our old 11 cu ft microwave yet it can do more + The colors are awesome The stainless is only on the front which makes for less to clean and the gray top and sides are not stainlessso they will keep cleaner + The dials and quick microwave settings are smart To reheat something for 30 seconds just press the button on the bottom right once for 30 seconds twice for a minute etc Or press the microwave button turn the dial to the time you'd like backwards or forwards and then press the start button + The clock setting is easy to set + The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees Preheat the oven first and then select the convection oven You'll need to read the directions in the manual first but then it's easy to navigate from there on out + The oven includes a crispy plate two wire racks that worked great on the convection setting a glass plate and ring I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy What may concern you  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit not on a power cord It does not have a long cord so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe One review for this microwave was mistakenthey said you couldn't use plastic in it Not true You just have to use microwave safe materials There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving Otherwise it's going to be a pain to clean it up Other matters to address It's always interesting to read other people's reviews One reviewer didn't like the manual because a cookbook wasn't included Honestly I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them The manual for this oven seems small but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use itand more No recipes but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables reheating foods etc I don't cook in my microwave oven normally I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven though on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven That's not true actually If you use the microwave function the time counts down normally If you use the convection setting you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done If you find you need a few extra minutes it's very easy to turn it right back on To use the convection oven you do need to preheat the oven first but that's not a problem One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button so the time didn't keep going either Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off All in all I'm very pleased with this microwave It covers the basics and beyond very well I don't expect it to do everythinggrill slimfry microwave convection But the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess I'm extremely happy with what I've used it for so farics and beyond very well I don't expect it to do everythinggrill slimfry microwave convection But the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess I'm extremely happy with what I've used it for so far

Is as described I have had this Microwave for about a month I'm still learning how to use all it's features I own two microwaves and this is my secondary one It is very quiet when it is cooking The one negative I have noted so far is that when an item is done cooking it beeps three times but if you don't open the door or hit stop it will beep about once every minute
Multifunctional and Perfect Size We decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen so a bulky over the range microwave was out Plus we never use it to 34cook34 from scratch Why have such a giant wasting space? My dear handy wood worker husband built our new cabinets so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave Love the drop down door Plus the features are incredible SlimFry convection and grill Note The Samsung is not meant for under the counter however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation so it has not been a problem
Love this little microwave Love this little microwave We recently sold our home and have had to live temporarily in a small one bedroom with very little counter space I found this one and based on reviews decided to buy it and I am not disappointed Works better than any microwave I have ever owned before Very pleased with my purchase
I've had this microwave for a couple of months and I've had this microwave for a couple of months and I have no problems with it it is working very well
Five Stars Great for the money
I love this microwave so much I love this microwave so much Aesthetically it's the coolest kitchen appliance I own It's also pretty powerful That said it's kinda small inside and square plates 16 oz coffee cups and popcorn bags can pose difficulties eg when the popcorn bag starts to fill up the tray stops turning I still wouldn't trade it in
Great microwave After several months of use I'm happy to report it's still running strong It heats food evenly with cold areas and is large enough to fit just about everything I cook The sleek design and color also look nice in my kitchen
Three Stars As described
Five Stars LOVE IT
Great value for money and does everything it promises This is a very versatile microwave The basic functions of a microwave heating reheating defrosting all are performed excellently But this unit does so much more it comes with stacking parts that allow you to heat or reheat two plates simultaneously which is extremely convenient Best of all it is a convection microwave so you can pretty much do everything you would need with this microwave bake a cake broil etc You can cook fried items in a manner that limits oiliness I like the pull down door rather than the open out variety that function saves space actually Decently sized a little smaller than my previous microwave but as much size as you could need Stainless steel is great matches the rest of my kitchen and its a highended looking device Very solid well built good value for money and does everything it promises
GREAT Microwave Great Unit We use it in our Semi and it works wonderfully well Great size and shape for a compact area I would definately recommend this unit 
Easy cooking Easy install no video or instructions required If you can get out to see where it is you can get to it and install it Unit is running fine with no issues
I am so happy I love this microwave Small is what I needed but wow what great extra features and it is beautiful I am beyond happy Yes it is small but that is what I needed and what I am used to I can't get my largest dinner plate in but I can get my smaller ones in I love how the back is rounded I had a Sharp Half Pint that finally died after 24 yrs This has way more features than the Sharp I have very little counter space so thank goodness I found this Yes it is pricey but well worth the money to me UPDATE 626262I purchased it 122014 and it died April 3rd2015 Whirlpool has been very nice and will be sending a replacement
One Star stopped working after 3 months total junk
Adequate but noisy Since we only use a microwave to heat or reheat food I decided to forgo all the bells and whistles when our last one stopped working This one was the lowest priced one that met the color size and wattage I wanted Pros Heats food as expected Cons Noisy While the microwave works fine for it's intended purpose it's extremely noisy compared to our previous microwaves and occasionally makes an odd rumbling sound which may be from it not sitting level since one leg is shorter than the others I attempted to adjust the leg without success so tucked a piece of folded cardboard under it to keep the microwave somewhat level Also at first the door was extremely difficult to push open but that has gotten better with use
Overheats with minimal use This microwave OVERHEATS if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn Once it overheats it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available thus making it take forever to heat anything You have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down The microwave works well if you don't use it too much at once But for more intensive use buy something more powerful
One Star This item dod not work from the second i opened the nox
Five Stars Really nice
It works fine but we hate the push to open button It works fine but we hate the push to open button We end up pushing the whole microwave awayyou need to use your other hand to hold the microwave in place
but the Microwave is fast and easy to use The Grill doesn't toast as well as a dedicated toaster oven but the Microwave is fast and easy to use The fast preheat and the convection oven cook accurately and are perfect for smaller households I haven't used the air fry yet
Super cute Works great Super cute Works great Because it's compact some bowls and plates fit a little snug and the rotating plate has no off Otherwise it's fantastic
I said fine and went and bought another microwave [[VIDEOID567df035967d824cead7d2509901668b]] The unit went out after the initial warranty had expired The unit was listed as having a 10 year warranty on the Magnetron The Magnetron the main engine of the microwave I jumped thru hopes for weeks including taking videos of the product shooting flaming sparks with Samsung warranty service only to be told that they do not have a service agreement near Arkansas Another week passed and I spoke with them one the phone and they we finally agreed on a partial refund and they sent me an email confirming the amount I said fine and went and bought another microwave They never sent the refund and I called a week later and they said that I had to provide them parts from the original microwave???easily done if they had told me this before They never said a word about it either on the phone or email This unit should last longer than it did I feel stupid that I have bought a kitchen full of Samsung appliances Now ifwhen these break I will have to deal with the same deceptive people and lack of support againSteer clear

Four Stars I am satisfy
Great microwave I love this microwave I needed something that could go in my new kitchen island and I did not want to spend a fortune for something that had mediocre ratings This microwave has had mixed reviews but it is working great for our household I would say the only somewhat negative is that the door is slightly slow to open compared to a regular microwave door that opens manually Overall I am very pleased with this purchase
Five Stars heats great gets very hot

A Whirlpool Lemon I purchased this microwave in February 2014 It was perfect size but stopped working within three months After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a threemonth period that a check would be sent for the purchase price They apologized for the delay at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system Then after three months of promises Whirlpool stopped all communication with me More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my BuyBack check I don't expect to get one Do not buy this product You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon In my case I lost $15278 and spent many many hours time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties at least not for this product PS 10 days after this review was posted Whirlpool issued a refund check
but is a great fit for our family of 7 A little loud but is a great fit for our family of 7
Five Stars Perfect for apartments
But the unit works great in all categories Direct replacement in my RV for the original that lasted over 15 years I hope I get that same life out of this one All of the previous reviews were spot on in the fact that the new one is very hard to get the two mounting bolts to start took about 40 minutes and the new models fan and motor are far louder than the old one was But the unit works great in all categories
Very pleased We put the unit inside a cabinet with Very pleased We put the unit inside a cabinet with a sliding shelf One less thing exposed in the kitchen

It does the job looks nice I am happy with it and the big what can you say about a microwave ?? It does the job looks nice I am happy with it and the big plus it was delivered right to my door No hunting around carrying it in and out of auto 
Five Stars Seems to be good quality
Your results may vary Paint itself seems to work well depending upon WHERE you paint If your microwave is like mine with a turntable the factory paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table NOTE My oven is at least 10 years old I read the paint can's directions thoroughly scraping off all the old loose paint and rust The paint says use it in a wellventilated area I suggest you wait for a nice lowhumidity day and use the paint outdoors It smells quite bad Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors I also waited 24 hours before reinstalling the turntable and using the microwave Results Within 2 months the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels and I'm back where I started before painting So I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear this paint will work fine Under turntable wheels not so much PREVENTION ADVICE Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use Some foods such as potatoes generate a lot of steammoisture in the oven which drained UNDER the turntable I didn't always notice the moisture and that's what caused the rusting in the first place
Five Stars Replaced in Sharp Microwave took about 30 minutes now turntable works again
great microwave awesome replacement great quality with bells and whistles

Microwave Chef is enjoying the meals Great range and matched my whirlpool stove perfectly There was a little dent on the side but it was not visible once it was installed great Buy and if needed in the future I would purchase this item again Works fabulously and is very nice and easy to use
one piece interior which looks like it will outlast all the microwaves in my future After two brandnew microwaves which became prematurely aged paint peeling dysfunctional I decided this must be a game that I had not grokked When we looked for a microwave we did not look on the basis of price being believers you get what you pay for This machine and it is a machine made by man work flawslessly and has a baked enamel one piece interior which looks like it will outlast all the microwaves in my future I will watch and reporttwo months and counting
this is a very nice microwave this is a very nice microwave very easy to use with a great size to accommodate just about any item you need to prepare Works fast and I would highly recommend it

Five Stars Perfect for what I needed I love this microwave
Fits perfect in our limited space Exactly what we were looking for It has been working great for several months now It was perfect for our very limited space a microwave box suspended below the cabinet and off the counter It is quite a nice stainless steel look complementing other appliances and black granite
Five Stars This is a great microwave
Almost perfectjust one flaw This little microwave is almost perfect I'm having a kitchen remodel and didn't want to build in a microwave whichlet's face itis mostly a giant water boiling machine I got this little one to use during my remodel and I plan to use it once my kitchen's remodeled too The time goes up in increments of 30 seconds 1 minute 130 2 minutes etc I wondered if that would work for me but it's just fine I also found out however that the power goes up in increments 25 50 75 100 Sometimes I use my microwave to 34soften34 butter and I need the lower power of 10 If the microwave offered increments of 10 20 30 etc it would be perfect Because it doesn't I may have to take this one to work and get myself a different microwave for home
Easy to install Shipping was fast and the packing was supreme Easy to install we are doing a remodel and I had my points to use So happy I used them on this microwave My other appliance are whirlpool and it looks great with everything
Five Stars Perfect size for my small kitchen Very attractive Easy to operate and performs well
Five Stars Worked great
This Sharp drawer microwave is amazing It has buttons to both open and close This Sharp drawer microwave is amazing It has buttons to both open and close the drawer for you We love the easy 34top loading34 system Plusit looks great We highly recommend this item
Great product great price I thought I would wait to make sure everything was working correctly before I commented The microwave is the perfect fit for my kitchen It works exactly as expected and I was surprised a dinner plate fits too It takes up a corner of my counter but it's very sharp looking I've had many compliments I am a very satisfied customer
Best Microwave so far It is a great microwave Had to replace the one that came with the house same model since my boyfriend burned the inside of it It is quick quiet and I love all the features about it Easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriendthen he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen
Fits Dinner Plates Just Fine Good Power and Stable Rotating Carousel Perfect for studioheating single plate leftovers It perfect for a studio or smaller kitchen It fits a standard 105 inch IKEA dinner plate just fine with space to spare but anything much larger would probably not fit Power wise its fine it takes 230 to 300 minutes to bring a mug of water to boil and heats up my leftovers just fine Clean design and stable carousel that rotates 360 degrees as it cooks One reviewer complained about an unstable carousel but I think they forgot to install the circular runner that provides support on the periphery of the carousel glass plate The runner is taped to the inside packaging with the owners manual
Works great This turntable is exactly like the one that came with the microwave The original cracked because my son dropped it so found this one on Amazon and it works fine
Looks good works well Looks good works well Does the microwave thing Venting is open at the top though Things can fall in That's a strange design
Questionable quality After 17 months there was a popping sound and electrical smell and it died We just warmed food up in it No serious cooking It is a great size and convenient Is it worth the price for a year and a half of service? It lost the high setting about 6 months ago but we didn't care too much You might want to pass on this model
Five Stars What a great value
Seemed to work fine in the house but didn't get along with my Seemed to work fine in the house but didn't get along with my RV inverter Returned Bigger than most 700 watt units  Handle sticks out quite a bit so not a 34space saver34
I feel like I made a big mistake buying this online I feel like I made a big mistake buying this online I would find a better brand and quality then bigger one for even less buying it local I paid over $100 shipping and it doesn't worth it it's small and at the beginning it didn't heat It's more or less now but not what I expected
Works great for us No issues I love the product
and it looked great The only problem was the screws came with installed it for PEB7226SFSS and it looked great The only problem was the screws came with it for mounting to the bracket were too short I went to HD purchased longer screws and screwed in perfectly
Five Stars part is same as picture
space saver this is a unique microwave in style and performance it doesn't heat as high as most but the size and shape is what sold me it fits nicely into a corner of my counter i don't use a microwave for much other than reheating things so this for me is perfect it is a very basic microwave i really like that the light goes off after a bit if you leave the door open
but mostly I'm happy that it fits on our counter and under the This microwave has a very elegant design The engineers were able to minimize its footprint by putting most of its electronics on the bottom instead of on the side I would prefer green LEDs instead of blue but mostly I'm happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space
 if I had known the inlet cover which seems like just a piece of cardboard is just tacked on I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover which seems like just a piece of cardboard is just tacked on the inside of the microwave I've never seen that before It's not listed in the item description I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews While I do cover food in the microwave it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off
Five Stars love it so far
Terrible worked for 12 day
 unique design with the rounded back are what I love about this microwave The small size and the unique design with the rounded back are what I love about this microwave Unfortunately the quality is just not great The glass plate got a chip on it within the first week of using this I've never had that happen to me ever before with any other microwave The plastic layer over the buttons has bubbled up and looks really cheap If these two things were fixed I would give this 5 stars because it's just a perfect size
Five Stars Excellent product Saved our microwave
Five Stars Works greats

Four Stars a little noisy but works good
Danby Microwave The Microwave works Great I really like the fact that it has a little smaller outside dementions than similar Microwaves of this Power Rating ONE COMPLAINT They Offer 2 extra months of Warrenty Coverage if you register Online Immediately I did and They didn't give them to me Also the Coverage starts on the day of purchase not day of receipt from UPS AMAZON The additional Warranty I purchased from Assurant Solitions DOES Start on the day of receipt is CHEAPER than The Warrranty from DANBY I wonder WHY?
Heavy duty Product has not default but the weight is way too much for the size of the microwave Easy to use Could the weight has something to do with the power of the engine? Only the technicians will be able to say something about it But will definitely recommend it to whoever is looking for good but affordable microwave Outstanding for the prize
Five Stars Creates a perfect custom look
 microwave for a few weeks and so far are happy with our purchase we have been using this microwave for a few weeks and so far are happy with our purchase it was easy to install looks nice and is doing a fine job of heating up our food we have no concerns at this time
yup works well for a small rental unit yup works well for a small rental unit
Very nice range good choice for 5burner double oven Very much enjoying this range I used to have double wall ovens and a Jenn Air cooktop with grillgriddle We've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that I had with that setup The small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and I but I do expect the large oven will get a workout at Thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner The Power Boil is terrific and the grillgriddle is very handy and easy to clean I debated quite a bit between this and the PGB950SEFSS The main differences  This model has a porcelain top surface the 950 is stainless The 950 has a doublering 19000 BTU boil burner this has a singlering 17000 BTU The 950 has dual broiler burners this has one broiler The 950 has a ballbearing roller rack I believe just one of the three where this has all standard slide racks $700 MSRP price difference To be honest I prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically but that's definitely a matter of opinion The other features just didn't add up to $700 for me I did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine but I can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish The Power Boil is excellent on this I don't see 10% higher BTU making a tremendous difference I also considered these other fiveburner doubleoven ranges Frigidaire FGGF304DLF KitchenAid HGRS505XSS LG LDG3036ST and Whirlpool WGG7550BS All have their benefits and drawbacks but the GE has the largest ovens and I got a good price through Amazon
this seems to be a nicely designed unit I bought this to replace my decades year old GE microwave After reading all the reviews this microwave convection was close to top with the added feature that it might actually work with the existing GE wall mount it didn't Overall this seems to be a nicely designed unit I am using convection cooking all the time now or even starting with microwave and ending with convection to warm things I won't nuke It seems to me that a proper review would be done a year from now and not before the plaster has dried
good deal working well good size and good price I like this
NOT Recommended Only buy if you HAVE to for small space issues UGH I wished I had NOT purchased this microwave the ONLY good things about it is the rounded back to fit nicely in the corner of my counter the 30second quickstart button and having the light stay on while cooking it's the weakest wattage microwave I've ever had having to relearn how to do simple things that take 1 12 times the amount of time to cook I miss the traditional power level buttons and being able to key in 15 minutes instead of pressing the start button 30 times I do NOT recommend this at all
Because I was stung by the fatal malfunction of the Because I was stung by the fatal malfunction of the digital display on my 1 12 year old Samsung microwave this time I opted for a semimanual operating system It's a mixed blessing Hopefully it will last longer but it's cumbersome Want 10 seconds to melt butter? Nope 15 seconds only Want to use the timer? You must press the button THREE times to activate it The convection cycle seems slow but works These are little things and I'm hoping this microwave will carry me through at least 45 years of irritation
A real lifesaver Worked Perfectly
Looks Great Looks GoodWorks Well
Four Stars Just a little too small for me
does the job it lacks power but generally speaking it does the job
Five Stars Excellent product I recommend it
Value for money Delivered in 2 days a day ahead than promised Good product many features and easy to use
Works Great Works Great
Came damaged but did not see til after use Came damaged but did not see til after use Hard to read just not worth the money Put in garage and went back to our $59 sams club microwave
So farso bad DIFFICULT to install even with two people mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $5000 It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced part had to be ordered Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place
Four Stars Easy to use
Two Stars Item had tarnished spots on it Not what I expected for the price Looks very cheap
Sharp makes dull products Product just isn't built to last when buying these types of appliances best to get something you can unplug and replace This product and company just do not hold upEquipment brand new 52713 installed Aug13 stopped working 15 months later
High tech microwave Great microwave and very fancy but it does get hot when you used it I usually leave it open for a few minutes when I finished using it
Five Stars The item was fine The price was great too compared other sellers
 this for my brother and he said it is great Great price point and it works really well I bought this for my brother and he said it is great Great price point and it works really well
Five Stars Very pleased with my purchase
very annoying Only a 30 day return policy too Do not buy this ever When door closes it automatically turns on and you are unable to start any kind of cooking options very annoying Only a 30 day return policy too
Five Stars Works great
Right size right power Microwave The Danby 1100w Microwave oven has proven to be the right purchase for my apartment The unit is fairly compact given it's power rating and because I have limited counter space size does matter to me In my opinion the Danby is an excellent product and made in America
Five Stars Very good
Perfect for apartment living I bought this for an easy to use microwave for my elderly parents They love it and use it way too much now
Four Stars Powerful for it's size fits anywhere especially above refrigerator
Great buy for the money Hard to beat for the price Bought this for a temporary living situation and couldn't ask for more for the price As an older person the only improvement would be larger buttons for the startstop but that would add cost Cooks fast and is an excellent choice
Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING I have extensive experience in refinishing metals it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum I powersanded the entire interior down to bare metal Contrary to the LABEL claims THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL Once dried it scrapes off with your fingernail Q The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer?? A IT CAN'T If I were to repeat this process I'd have first primed it with a hightemp selfetching automotive primer Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success Bottom Line Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT PS 2 Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior
Five Stars Great product for the money
but fits nicely over the range Looked large in the box but fits nicely over the range Looks great and works great Has met all expectations and for a lot less than other microwaves for more
Five Stars Great price easy to use
Four Stars Great for Dorm rooms
Good Value in a stainless microwave This is a beautiful microwave that happens to match all our other appliances I bought it to replace a Samsung that had burned out It does an adequate job but the food cooked for the same length of time is not as hot as with the Samsung Each microwave had the same power but the Samsung was more powerful I should add that it was also more expensive The Whirlpool is a good buy
I won't buy appliance online again Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller So it had to be sent back My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince
works great Quiet and powerful impressive for the priceworks great Quiet and powerful opening the door is two handed sometimes but a good value
Everything is good so far Everything is good so far The price was low and I didn't know the brand But took a chance I have had no problmns
Five Stars A very nice product I especially like the night light
The product delivers Great seems to be holding up just fine I sanded and cleaned the area as directed and put on several coats allowing the paint to dry in between coats I finished it off with a light sanding using extra fine sand paper The color is slightly off but otherwise it looks and feels like new I also have plenty left should I need to touch
We installed this microwave three months ago and it was We installed this microwave three months ago and it was working well until several days ago when we set the convection bake to heat at 375 degrees and after 15 minutes the device completely shutdown It has completely died I set up an evaluation and repair with GE between 8 12 am and by 11 30 am they still hadn't showed up and I needed to leave for the office BTW I had a similar experience when I scheduled a repair for my GE washer I will never by GE again After 3 months to have problems with a brand new appliance is unacceptable
Cheapy door and button panel returning Door doesn't open when you hit the button you have to hold the button in with one hand and then pull the door open with a 2nd hand Buttons are cheapy just a cardboard panel comes with a 2nd cardboard panel in French to swap out Seems like it heats OK but the door is a deal breaker I'm returning it I've never returned anything from Amazon but I hate it that much
Space saving and works Works great and saves space in our tiny kitchen It's small though cannot fit anything larger than a dinner plate or taller than a large coffee mug
Did the job and has held up even after a Did the job and has held up even after a year of use it has extended the life on the microwave
Exactly what I needed to repair my microwave at about Exactly what I needed to repair my microwave at about a 14 of the price that most appliance parts retailers wanted
DO NOT BUY SO DISAPPOINTED Bought this July 2013 and our kitchen was not ready yet so we didn't put it in until a few months ago and it worked fine we probably used it only couple dozen times and my husband went to warm up our daughters food Wednesday and NOTHING Completely 34dead34 Will not turn on no buttons works etc This is extremely disappointing and our warranty was up July 2014 This is why you do not spend $800 on a microwave and I will NEVER purchase a SHARP product ever again Totally sad and disappointed
Three Stars ok
It's easy to use It works very well It's easy to use It' runs quieter then our old one And it heats and reheats everything we want The only thing I notice is it's very light weight It tips easily if you lean on it
Good so far This was rated fairly high by Consumer Reports and usage over the past month or so has borne that out It is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly The basic controls are fairly intuitive though apparently I have to set the power level before I set the cook time rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave The special features like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam are things that I don't seem to be able to get the hang of After playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad I was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items I don't like the push button opener I think that is what will break first and then I won't be able to open the door I do not regret the purchase so far If the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase
Whirlpool Microwave I have a small kitchen This fit perfectly in a corner on the counter It looks super cute and I have received several compliments
One Star It did not work upon arrival
Compact It's small and fits perfectly in a corner Microwaves things
For the price it a nice unit easy to use etc For the price it a nice unit easy to use etc Only negative is the door latch button is hard to pushopen
Works great Just the right size I just got it today Works great Just the right size Just the right price You could not get a better one for this price
fit into my small kitchen just fine Not very big fit into my small kitchen just fine
Five Stars as described
Received with damages in the back and on the sides Received with damages in the back and on the sides Contacted seller with no response I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item It is overpriced but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new Also the handle is made of plastic not stainless steel as it appears to be The Tape made to look like stainless steel keeps peeling from the heat of the range and exposing the plastic more everyday I have had this microwave for 8 months now and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone It is functional but looks really tacky
Works as advertised This little sucker has been heating up our food reliably for going on a year It fit into a cabinet space that no other microwave could fit into Yeah it's a little underpowered but you get used to that It fits a whole plate which is nice but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate Fullsize popcorn bags have this problem for example But overall great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space
Four Stars This is a good turntable place fo rmy microwave perfect fit
Pretty basic features This small microwave has worked well for my small kitchen Pretty basic features but has worked fine
WORST appliance I have EVER owned Never worked well intermittently stops working then starts again I would have returned this in the first WEEK but once this monster is hung on the wall and it's made its first bag of popcorn who keeps the shipping box?? It finally died after the fan would not turn off now it's completely inert The only bright side is it will fit in my community's GARBAGE CANS This unit has been a frustration since installation
Perfect for us We purchased and installed this over the range microwave as a replacement for a 25 year old one This is Sharp is just perfect We required one with the recirculating feature because we have no way to vent it and this type is not easy to find
Very Happy I just received this I was looking for the most compact microwave with the best reviews and this was it So far I tried boiling a cup of water and fixed a baked potato It works just great Yes I would recommend this
Gets the job done at a great price Gets the job done and it was a great price
works great Figuring out how to warm without presets is As advertised compact works great Figuring out how to warm without presets is kind of complicated Not impossible however
it fits nicely It fits nicely into the corner of the counterdoesn't take up as much counter space But it does not cook as fast as a large microwave but for popcorn and heating coffee it does just fine
Low budget great microwave Family is so busy with working and kids When old microwave died right after moving and expecting a baby money was very tight My mom saw our needs and purchased this microwave as a surprise This little thing is just right for our smaller kitchenit reheat foods fast and works great Family is very pleased
From a creative genius mind The person who designed this should have won a prize Makes the most of a small corner space and is more efficient about 20% more efficient Great purchase
Five Stars great for work
I love this little microwave I love this little microwave It fits on my countertop easily and does not take up a lot of space It is large enough to heat everything I use a microwave for The controls are intuitive and easy to use The high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts I was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer The only minor annoyance I have after several days of use is that I have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven My cup measures 634 tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in However I found if I remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns it fits perfectly
It's 26 and 12 so there was a 14 gap on both sides Would look nice if it 27 trim kit isn't 27 inches It's 26 and 12 so there was a 14 gap on both sides Would look nice if it fit
Five Stars Perfect
Works better than I thought it would Worked so much better than I expected Two light coats and it looked like new
Three Stars Fast shipment decent product Doesn't cook evenly
Well built Very well made with stainless interior Cooks well but has few bells and whistles which is fine Four stars because visibility while cooking is not what I'm used to Still a good deal for the price
One Star Did not work so I returned it
Simple Inexpensive and straightforward option This microwave works well on a counter top My previous Microwave had a analog timer so I'm obviously not too picky about microwaves It should get the job done on most foods The quality is a bit iffy though because the first one I received from Amazon was half 34caved in34 literally It's really lightweight and simple in design A good inexpensive option for regular everyday heating
Exactly what was needed for my 638 sq ft condo This is just adorable not quite the power of my old AND HUGE microwave oven This one is SLEEK and SMALL and very hightech looking It tucks in under my kitchen countertop and in a corner out of the way I have to nuke things a bit longer with this one but that's okay
Wonderful product My first time using anything like this Wonderful product My first time using anything like this for microwave repair of burned areas I was not sure if it would work but to my surprise it exceeded my expections I highly reccomend this product
Four Stars Still learning how to use it
The template was completely wrong on where to put the The template was completely wrong on where to put the screw holes on top resulting in too many holes being drilled into the shelf above Other than that this was a solid purchase
Can't beat this deal Great item good pricegreat quality
The button to open the microwave door is too tight The button to open the microwave door is too tight You need both hands to open the door If I'm not too lazy I would return it
Five Stars very nice
Does the job This stuff adheres well dries quickly and leaves a washable surface I used it to replace bubbling paint on a microwave with a painted mild steel lined cavity
Cheap quality Cheap quality But you always get what you pay for 
Four Stars Love this product works fine
Four Stars Love the form factor but a bit difficult to read display
Microwave Cavity Paint has worked out great so far This microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far We have a GE incabinet microwaveoven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave I was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item So I sanded down the top of the microwave really well Be sure to get ALL loose paint off should be totally smooth Then when the paint arrived I shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave It was actually a pretty good sized area I needed to cover After letting that coat dry for a couple hours I added a second coat and after a couple more hours I added a third coat I want to make sure it was coated good So far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great I showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now I let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use The smell is overwhelming and I would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face I would take a counter top unit outside to treat I didn't have that option so I had to just do it
IT TALKS TO YOU AND DOES THE JOB love the microvaveespecially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigateheats wellwe're very satisfied with it
Perfect I love this new little microwave I had no room in my small kitchen but I hardly know it's there it takes up so little space The only thing I don't like is there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table more parts to worry about should they ever get lost The plate rests on one of the plastic parts the turner with wheels which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom which makes smaller space to fit tall items There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit The whole unit is easy to clean ALL including the inside is flat and smooth no dials or protrusions It has only a 30 second button so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes which perfectly heats a cup of coffee The only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes I don't know why the manufacturer would choose 34popcorn34 when coffeetea is used much more often This small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily I am very happy with this product so easy to use and clean
A good small microwave This is a truly compact microwave I wanted something with a small footprint but functions well This oven has fit the bill It sits in a corner on my counter As some have mentioned you can't program the time you want but have to hit the controls to add 5 seconds or 30 seconds This aspect is not ideal but also not big large problem I am very satisfied with this purchase
best part I did not have to go anywhere Same as it was described best part I did not have to go anywhere it came to my house right on rime
The quality and deliverry where very good but I returned it unused as it weighed too The quality and deliverry where very good but I returned it unused as it weighed too much and the rounded corners in the rear didnt fit my application Its a nice unit but didnt work for me
Five Stars Very well made and easy to install Great shipping on this bulky item
It's OK but far from perfect It's OK but not perfect The 'buttons' are hard to see in dim light and offer zero tactile feedback It's way to easy to hit the 30 second button more than one time if you're not careful I stuck some small felt adhesive pads over the buttons I use frequently That helped quite a bit You can find them in low light and when you press it you know it
Four Stars Love it
NO HEAT Got it detected right from the box The lights work control panel etc but it doesn't produce any heat 5 minutes and nothing Really sad about the quality Amazon send me a broken device
Five Stars Excellent Easy install Microwave works like new
Happy outcome Even though it's a GE magnetron it solved my Frigidaire model PLMV168CC1 over therange microwave noheating problem Saved us of having to buy a new microwave Happy outcome
More units should be available in this shape and size Look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape If you live in a small apartment counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space That was the case in our place We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events Not fun Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit I saw this one and had a Eureka moment Since it is only about 14 inches wide I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up it's great It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave A magic eraser got rid of that The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter the microwave slides when you try to open the door They should have built this with nonslip feet I cut a couple of squares of that nonslip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem The inside of this unit is very small Keep that in mind It is a tall unit but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here 5 1234 would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space
One Star poorly built
Five Stars Works great
But the thing is beautiful My husband had to do some work to I was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews But the thing is beautiful My husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space The results were wonderful And now I have a builtin microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances The look is very nice
Have been working good so far Cute little mw Have been working good so far No issues Good enough for a couple to warm upheat things in small quantity Takes a little more time quite natural as its just 700 watts but reasonable enough Overall a nice buy Pros Easy to operate Many quick options Cute little and looks sturdy a big space saver if you have small kitchen space Cons None so far Overall a no nonsense simple mw for day to day use Serves the purpose
Burned out in less than 30 minutes of use I purchased this item brand new I used it only a few times in a period on less than 2 months It failed in less than 30 minutes of use Amazon's return policy doesn't cover this item and nobody keeps the product box so the manufacturer warranty may be worthless more in shipping than product is worth Do not buy this item
So far so good Very roomy compared with my last one Its very quiet and heats well So far so good
perfect effiient spacious easy quiet fast doe what it supposed to do I purchased this for my office and am more than glad i did
Very neat and good This is a perfect kitchen microwave I am thrilled with it Great price for the value you get Must say I am very satisfied
Perfect size I was looking for a very 34 small34 microwave for my rv This one is perfect and looks very nice
To small This item is for students in a dorm room not big enough for a 8' inch plate It does not take up to much space and it is over price
This IS a small microwave turntable fits an average size tv dinner barely It arrived in an Amazon outer box with just a couple wads of paper Thank goodness the regular packaging was done proper tightly packed box from manufacturer The Amazon box was tore up No markings to say 34fragile34 Luckily it worked It appears to function just the way it should no issues Clean design easy to read display I would have gave it 5 stars but a pass down the microwave aisle at the local Walfart saw similar or even better values for price and size although just a few dollars on price
meh I received this microwave and it didn't work I plugged it in and tried several outlets but the clock didn't light up and it didn't respond to me pushing any of the buttons It was really easy to get a new one from amazon and they shipped it very quickly So far the second one has been great and exactly what i wanted However I had to return the first one that didn't work and the shipping methods were extremely inconvenient Ups will only pick it up from my house during the day when I'm at work I had to take it to the post office but i don't have a car so i had to carry it and walk several blocks In addition the max shipping reimbursement wasn't enough so i'm out another $5 for their mistake
IT WORKS I purchased this to repair my microwave and to save big bucks on a new one it's been a while since I purchased it and it is still turning steady and strong great product
Small and low tech = perfect Super simple to use no bells and whistles and tiny tiny footprint Works in my small kitchen so I'm happy with the purchase
this is so cool i LOVE this microwave it is cool works great and frees up the counter it fit seamlessly into the required hole listed in the specs and if you want a range hood and not a microwave over the stove this is the only way to go
It is what it is For the price you pay you get what you pay for It does the job its a little on the small side but that is what it is Happy with what I got till I can afford a bigger one
Small and light useful freatures Never realized how small 07 cu ft was going to be but now I do Ah well it works like it should just don't expect to put a huge plate on their Quick touch buttons are the best anywhere from 30 seconds to minutes with one touch
Nice little mic Ovenfine for meuse it mostly for reheating foodsmall size good for one personHeats well Please see aboveam pleased with my choice good value and works well so far Timer seems to work wellGood booklet with directions
great product awesome product and delivery microwave looks spanking new now you cant find this product in stores lord only knows i hope i wont be diagnosed cancer in a couple of years as result
Quit Working After 2 12 Years of Use We really enjoyed using this microwave while it lasted however after 2 12 years of use it just stopped working one day We chose this drawertype microwave because we wanted to 34hide34 our microwave in our island for aesthetic purposes and for this reason were willing to pay more for it If I could do it again I would definitely have splurged for one of the more expensive drawer microwaves that are available from manufacturers other than Sharp Yes Sharp makes the cheapest version of this type of microwave but we learned the hard way that you get what you pay for
burnt up after 2 months works fines initially then as the title says I literally got a puff of black smoke and it was dead
Works Perfectly Prep surface carefully Be sure to leave no residue on surface to be painted Use multiple thin coats Allow sufficient time between coats for it to dry The color matches my microwave very well
Fast shipping Exactly how it was described This product came super fast And exactly as described The only down side is that it doesn't get as hot as it should I do live in Korea and have to use a converter box so that might be what's effecting it Other than that it is perfect
GE over the range Microwave Connvection Oven It works well Does everything I bought it for Easy to set and operate Does take a while to warm up for baking but operating on 110v it is to be expected
What a dud We purchased the MW in Janurary our contractor installed it the last week of April it died two days later and Sharp service took three weeks two service calls only to have it go out ten minutes after they left Amazon assures me that it will be resolved but not the seller They want to repeatly waste our time and call service have us wait then what? DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE
a good microwave Perfectly fit in my kitchen and power is OK it has everything I need for a basic microwave I've been using it for several days haven't found any problem yet
This microwave died after 4 uses I hope I sent in my warranty card I am calling the company today to request a refund I have not liked this microwave at all and now it suddenly died I definitely want my money back Edited I called the company and they told me to call Amazon I called Amazon and they issued a full refund I do not recommend this microwave It is so flimsy that I had to hold it still with one hand in order to push buttons with the other Otherwise it would slide across the counter
Worth it Trust me This may be more expensive than other microwaves but trust me when I say it is totally worth it for the design and counter savings
Excellent microwave Great product have owned 4 Sharp Carousel microwaves over the past 30 years or so and they always stand out over other microwaves I have used at friends and families homes The ease of use and guaranteed result is worth it every time The microwave is stylish and easy to clean the design has changed little in the 3 decades because it works and does not need changed The size as well is perfect for cooking anything microwavable Having 1200 watts is a huge plus when cooking things like baked potatoes and frozen stuff that on a lesser powered microwave would take longer then posted times but this oven will do the job in less time more often than not It is a stylish powerhouse
I recommend it I recommend this product because it works Rarely do you find a product that works as well as it says Read the instructions carefully and it will do the job
Good valuesmall issue Microwave performs as expected and was a good value Only complaint is with the alarm that sounds when the timer is complete 5beeps is a bit much and the alarm does not stop even if you open the door until those 5 beeps are complete Small issue but annoying all the same
pretty good lil microwave its a microwave and it works like a microwave Nothing fancy has the quick start buttons Was the cheapest 1000w one I found and I have no complaints
Worst EVER This is the worst microwave I have ever owned It takes twice as long to heat food We also have owned it for only a few months and the key pad broke
This fixed my microwave Works as advertised Much cheaper than a service call or a completely new microwave Just be sure you know how to confirm the problem so you know which part has failed search youtube An oven that won't heat is often but not always a failed magnetron
GOOD DEAL LOVE IT I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT DEAL KEEP THE DEALS CINUBG LOL
Sharp R1405 Microwave oven Arrived in two days instead of the week as reported this was a great plus It fit into the same spot as old Sharp another plus The mounting brackets were in a different location constructed less sturdy than the old ones The medal was cheaply made much thinner Overall I am happy with purchase
Great Microwave This is the perfect microwave for my household It is basically used for heating water and food Couldn't ask for anything better
Good Buy So I needed a basic microwave nothing fancy Let's face it no kitchen can function can live with out one Don't know how the settlers survived lol Anyway it arrived in about a week in perfect condition And far exceeded my expectations It looks just like the pic and even displays the time and has a timer It cooks very well also Over all yes buy it you won't be disappointed
Wouldn't buy again The door wants to catch When you push the numbers on the keyboard they seem cheap You have to push hard for them to work right This is the second one of same microwave we've had Purchased it so wouldn't have to remount hardware This second one seems like it's a reject or a second that a store is trying to get rid of
NOZZLE PROBLEMS AFTER I MADE EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS TO PAINT THE CAVITY OF THE MICROWAVE I NOTICED THE NOZZLE HAD A CRACK IN IT THAT I COULD NOT SEE UNTIL I HAD APPLIED THE PAINT THIS LED TO DRIPPING AND STREAKS IN THE PAINTING PROCESS IT MADE A TERRIBLE MESS AND THE RESULT WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I WOULD OF HOPED TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER CAN THAT I COULD USE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED NOZZLE BUT WITH NO RESULTS MY SUGGESTION IS SPRAY SOMETHING TO TEST HOW WELL THE NOZZLE WORKS BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL APPLIANCE
Whirlpool Microwave This microwave is perfect for a compact kitchen I have more counter space that is now useable than I had before It's small foot print is a blessing It is large enough to accommodate my needs The interior is spacious enough to reheat dinners or a slice of pizza I like making popcorn in it Would recommend this to anyone who has a small kitchen and is need of a unit with a smaller foot print
Magnatron arrived without diode Magnetron came quickly but the diode was not in the package as advertised I do not want to install the Magnetron without a new diode
Lovely Small package but large inside It will fit a full size plate Perfect counter microwave Takes up very little space in the corner We love it We have had many comments on how cool it looks from friends
Save on Counter Space I was looking for a more compact microwave because I don't have a lot of counterspace This works pretty good for that The only thing I didn't like is that the cord is on the back right side instead of in the back middle So I was unable to put the microwave in the spot I wanted because it wouldn't reach the outlet
Tippy Be Careful Nice small size for an out of the way spot on kitchenh shelve under counter In opening and closing take great care as it easily l tips forward
Good performance suspect reliability This is my second unit replacing one installed in a custombuilt cabinet I purchased this one solely for dimensional compatibility When working this microwave is excellent in all respects It runs quietly the controls are intuitive and it boasts a number of cooking programs that generally perform well Unfortunately after 52 years in service the first unit failed I was told the failed component was the magnetron an expensive part so I simply replaced it I hope the premature failure of the first unit was an aberration
Roomy This is pretty roomie has plenty of power and fits just about anywhere It looks like a TV though and is a bit loud
Do not waste your money with this After our GE Caf¨¦ microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix So we purchased this advantium oven It shipped and would not heat up We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better
Occasional use We got this as a backup when our large microwave broke It does a nice job and it's nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it The smaller size is really nice and doesn't take up a lot of space
MICROWAVE CAVITY PAINT 98QBP0302 I bought 3 of this if you sandclean you microwave throughly you only need to buy 2 to spray it
I like it Worked great
Microwave is great Works great and really great size for cooking multiple items easy to use without a lot of fancy buttons I recommend this to others But be sure of the size as this is a very large over the stove microwave
Whirlpool Microwave I love this The cord is on the right and short I could have used the word on the left but other than that because of my outlet location it deserves a full 5 stars It does reach to my outlet but would have been nicer on the left for the location I have the microwave Other than that I love this little microwave I do have too cook things 3060 seconds longer however the space I save it worth the extra cooking time Heats up food frozen vegetables and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly Fits a full sized plate or paper plate fits a 1034 bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top This is not for cooking meals small things only in my opinion and just what I needed and wanted
not what I thought I was ordering My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full
Spacemaker Over the Range Microwave It is perfect for my needs for space Size is good and so far performance has been good The extra rack is a nice addition
little experience with device yet setup and install directions unbelievably bad Device ok after only 2 weeks except that operating touch panel is not the work of genius and not really touch Big floppy paper templates for wall and overhead marks should be on or glued to stiff cardboard with perforations for marking Author of directions too expert to convey simple things failed to consider ceramic tiles on walls need carbide drills Directions were accurate tho clumsy
Perfect Exact device needed to solve my GE microwave problem My wife is happy now so I can be happy too
Excellent Price This was an excellent shopping experience I wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these Great Shopping Experience
Love the compact size People always ask what the hell is that thing parked on the fridge its the perfect size for me to warm up a single dish or a coffee I dont cook in a microwave its functional and its beautiful
You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning You can actually repair a Sharp Microwave that stops turning You'll be fooled at first because usually to fix some appliance you remove the cover or case or housing or whatever you call it the Cabinet Don't In fact on a Sharp Microwave they used some screws to hold on the cabinet that you don't have the wrench for It's like saying 34These arent' the screws you're looking for34 You don't need to see his identification papers The arcane baffling steps that aren't explained anywhere and that you haven't experienced before 1 The little perforated plate near the center of the back after you turn it upside down is removed by ripping it away manfully Never done that before on ANYTHING No screws just hack at it You'll be thinking 34But if I bend it and twist it how will it go back on? 34 Well first of all you can dispense with it but if you feel like it you can flatten it and then turn it over and you'll see how it has little tabs on it to reinstall it Actually once you get that little perforated plate off there it's trivially simple Carry on
Stunk hard to believe it is good for us I bought this thinking common spray paint might be a bad idea The can warned of the issue of fumes which in the usual manor I ignored I sprayed my microwave and man did it smell and really seemed like I should not have been so casual about the warning So then I thought if the fumes are so bad and they lasted for weeks how good is this crap to be so close to our food In my imagination it seems worse than a can of Rustoleum Who knows it was fairly expensive for a small can and it didn't give me a good feeling but again who knows?
Awesome appliance I really love this microwave The design is modern and appealing and the function is ideal for application I am very satisfied with having this product on my kitchen countertop
Good product I use microwave just to rewarm my food I barely use it to cook The product is cheap and good for rewarming my food I already used it for 2 months and have no problem I don't know how long it is going to last The product may also be good for cooking but I don't know since I don't cook with microwave
Great little microwave We needed a small microwave to fit in our newly refurbished 1995 VW Eurovan camper and this one is perfect It fits inside an existing cupboard I had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use but not when the door is opened This one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it's in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen Some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism Despite this microwave being a different brand that the two we have at home the turntable mechanism is the same and it only fits together in one specific position When it's properly aligned it pops into place and is very stable
It fits it works So many negative reviews on this site I agonized over getting it but it fits my space so I did It works just fine and I'm happy to recommend it if you're stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave It is a decent microwave for regular use
Love my microwave Easy to use and doesn't take up alot of counter space Also sits higher so it is easy to clean A little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food not cooking a ham or turkey in it
Looks sleek This brand was cheaper than some of the other major brands however this one was highly rated by Consumer Reports Got here in 2 days
Good product for the price We use these in our break rooms where they get conciderably more than use than they would in a home enviroment They are a great product for the price we seem to get on average 3 years use out of them The more expensive ones we tried lasted about the same amount of time
Works Just fine If I had read the reviews before purchasing this unit I probably would not have ordered it After reading the reviews I was worried that I had made a mistake However I have had it for several weeks now and it is working just fine I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because the door is a little hard to open But for the money it works quite well I'm pretty satisfied with this microwave
Purchase of Sharp Microwave Purchased from Amazon and was received within 5 days exceptional Since it was the same model as my old one installation was very easy with no new holes or brackets to install So far it works very well and I consider it at this point an exceptional purchase
Works Great We have a GE ovenmicrowave combo the microwave has the oven controls on it and the paint was coming off the microwave I was concerned it was dangerous so I considered replacing the entire unit Then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try My husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new Couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit
Don't forget the Microwave The appliance fits neatly my new kitchen perfectly we hardly notice it is even there The function works with all the setting of a regular machine it just a lot smaller the size a large dinner plate I love it
Compact Attractive Gets The Job Done Oven came quickly and well packaged and protected Gave it a try last night I'm in the middle of some inside renovation and used the microwave to have something quick to eat Things I like about this oven is the pull to open door and being able to heat food using 15 second increments You can also adjust cooking times while the oven is in use One other feature I really like is that the power cord is not ridiculously long You can plug this oven in and not have the cord showing from behind the microwave This is a very solid oven and am pleased with my purchase though it is a bit higher than most models Curved design of the oven also makes cleaning quicker and easier
Perfect We were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room but still large enough to make popcorn and other things This one fit the bill and it works great We love it
Looks and warms great but has a problem with the door closing Overall the appearance of this item looks great However I just installed this and there seems to be a problem with the drawer closing properly Essentially when one uses the close button or attempts to close the drawer manually it closes but then immediately reopens I found a way around this until a service agent can come to fix it which is to hold it closed so it does not reopen There is a little trick to it and it has to do with timing of when to hold it shut I did warm up a biscuit in it and it worked beautifully otherwise
disappointed baffled Disapointed in the fan suction Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove almost like there is a ducting leak because there is plenty of air blowing
OK el cheapo microwave It does what I bought it to do boil water and heat leftovers As stated in other reviews it heats VERY unevenly Since I only plan on having this microwave for a year or a year and a half I went into this purchase willing to put up with such an inconvenience If you are looking for a good microwave look elsewhere If you are looking for a cheap microwave that will hold you over until you can buy something bigger and better go ahead
Glad I bought it  This is a good little unit I wanted something of smaller dimensions so I could put it into my RV It fit perfectly and it works just fine Very attractive and very quiet It's taken a while to get used to the new controls but that's just because they're different not bad I plan to buy another for a small trailer that I have In short I would recommend this to anybody
Genius Design With other microwaves you lose not only it's own footprint in counter space but also the clearance in front for the door to open With this one the door opens 3 inches above the counter plenty of room for other food prep It tucks way back into the corner previously wasted space It's heavy enough to stay put when pulling the door open light enough to slide to the side for cleaning underneath Some reviewers criticized the controls but hey anytime you get a new appliance it takes a while to get used to the buttons Took me 2 rounds to decide the 30 second button was a great invention My kids said 34Whoa what's that34 the first time they saw it I think that's high praise in kidspeak
Its good recomende Its not working for what I buy this but use in my home kitchen Looks nice Easy for who not use so much microwave Want for my husband in Freightliner on road have hot food
Didnt even get to use it once Received this microwave The first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off  It now has no power at all I will be returning this and not purchasing a new one
Microwave Painting This product was easy to use and when the paint dried the paint blended in and match the original inside paint perfectly
Pretty good Purchased this Good for the price can't complain I would recommend this to a friend if you need a simple small microwave 
If it is broke buy it Great item It fits it perfectly I really enjoyed getting this item I definitely recommend anyone to purchase this item
Repaired my microwave My turn table would not turn I ordered this part and put it in and the microwave is as good as new
Saved my Microwave I had a ring of rust and metal on the bottom of my microwave oven My husband just wanted to buy a new oven but I had already ordered this product I worked great I followed direction I found online and my oven is like new again
Perfect fit This was a replacement and the fit and quality was perfect I would recommend the product to anyone needing a replacement
I was scared at first It is listed as stainless steel but a magnet stuck tight to it This is not typical of stainlessnot this much attraction Research through Google showed some stainless is magnetic I knew this but the attraction seemed too strongWas this a stainless steel coating over ironI do not know The microwave has worked very well for me I have no complaints Caution Some cleaners can pit SS Amonia should NEVER be used on stainles IFIF it was a SS coating and a PIT GOES to TO THE IRON My experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside The coating starts to seperate from the metal shell and fall into your food You remove it until it is almost all gone leaving the exposed metal shell to rust This has happened to me several times I am very pleased with the Danby Designer from Amazon
It works good But I don't like the fact that it doesn't have numbers I always go over the time I need or it takes too long if I do it manually It's also too small to fit large plates
Paint saves a perfectly good microwave She Who Must Be Obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake A little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into Her kitchen It feels good to go one up on this disposable society
College Kid I bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn't a day that goes by that I regret it This microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean It is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back
good microwave This Microwave is pretty good and very quite I love the way it looks in the kitchen However that being said the reason I am not happy with this item completely is because of the way it was packaged when shipped They don't box this item right and the corners are all exposed during shipping by the time I got it it was all warped and dented Luckily it was on the side that you cant see when installed and nothing was damaged except for the optional vent part that came with it Also the install directions are very confusing
Not worth the expense The light on the clock does not stay lit when micro not in use When the door opens and shuts the liquid in a cup or whatever may spill Also when reheating coffee from 711 it tips over
MICROWAVE CAVITY PAINT 98QBP03 I scraped and cleaned the area really we'll as per instructions but found that the paint started to peel again after three weeks
Serious Little Microwave This will fit in a small place and has room for a full size dinner plate It is very sturdy and well made You could go to Walmart and get a 40 dollar microwave and that might fit the bill But this will last
She said My wife does 90% of the cooking in our home and I asked her what she thought of our new GE Cafe Series CSA1201RSS 17 cu ft OvertheRange Advantium Speed Oven Microwave and she said 34I love it I may never use our regular range oven again34 I use it for the usual things that most men use it for Popcorn heating coffee warming left overs and the like and for me I think it is also great It reheats just about anything I have tried to just the right temperature If there are any cons with this appliance I haven't run across them yet
Perfect Fit Ordered because my turntable inexplicably shattered after 5 years This replacement was listed for my model number Perfect fir Great price No problems
Saved Me a Packet My microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave I didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and I didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it So in a couple of hours I cleaned the microwave directions online covered all surfaces from overspray and used this paint Now I have a new microwave and I keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used The rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again I am very happy
Great Space Saver I have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size Shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts However I have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave A few second for most things I don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks etc For my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction If you need a smaller sized microwave I highly recommend this one
Product was Great Really enjoyed the drawer type microwave and the auto open feature is a plus Comes with full warranty even though is is a refurbished model
Nice for the money I bought this microwave to fit into a cabinet So the measurments were most important to me Other than that it has everything I want in a microwave oven Full size to fit big plates The carousel works great Easy controls Several one push buttons for 1min 2min 3min even a 30 sec button Readouts are very bright and easy to see The only problem is the cabinet When I got this via UPS it was packed inside of a plain brown box Inside that box was the box that the microwave was shipped in In that box was a full surround of think styrofoam blocks along with some plastic and paperwork When I took it out of all the wrapping the cabinet was loaded with dents and one side was slightly collapsed I don't know how this could have happened unless it was done before shipping But why would they ship something they knew was so beat up? The only reason I can think of ispeople buy them to put in cabinets like I did I paid 9900 Great working microwave Terrible cabinet
My favorite microwave I was going to say despite its size this is a wonderful microwave but then I think the small size is the best part I bought it for my small kitchen and it's not only adorable it's a kick ass machine Love it
As described Part is as described Arrived in a timely fashion Installation was easy Direct replacement for the magnetron in our 10 year old GE spacemaker Microwave is working again
Horrible Had to return it received less than half the $ I paid for it Bulky odd shape very difficult to find suitable space for it Like I had an old TV on my counter UGLY very ugly
great i was going to replace the microwave checked it out and found it was the magnetron ordered this delivered FAST fixed it for under a 100 bucks
Great product I really thought our builtin microwave was going to have to be replaced because of the paint pealing away and rust forming where exposed To my amazement this inexpensive product solved my problem with ease Remember to have area well vented to the outside and to use a mask By using many light sprays you will prevent runs
great microwave I've just had this microwave installed in my new kitchen I wanted to find one that could go in my island and wouldn't detract from my new cabinets It's easy to use and is a great addition to my new kitchen
GE Microwave Oven Magnetron and Diode Kit OM75P Solved my Issues The parts were just what was needed They were the correct part as identified There was no variations and therefore installed just like the parts that were removed Have been working just fine since installed
Microwave Oven This microwave oven was purchased for work Everbody likes it Never have any problems Would purchase the same kind next time
Not working right The microwave is sparking while heating we are sending it back for a replacement will hope it works this time
Works Fine Works great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it
compact and great Microwave that takes half of the space of the previous fits in the corner and don't interfere with wifi Putting the magnetron beneath the microwave made it compact
Broken after 4 months I like the form fits well in the corner of our counter Fairly weak strength but adequate for heating up a bowl of food Biggest issue is that it is now DEAD after only 4 months of use Still trying to get Whirlpool to fix or replace it but customer service has not been stellar Day 5 after contacting them but still trying to reach the person I need
love the drewer We bought this for a new construction and haven't used it yet It looks great and hope it works just as well
Good microwave for small kitchens and as for the price The microwave is really OK as for the price if you don't need to have a 'fancy' big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes it's perfect I tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn it also works well CONS a little bit noisy when it's ending preparation popcorn button doesn't work well program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped PROS easy to use small builtin kitchen timer cheap
Does the trick It microwaves leftovers and it fits in the corner with a relatively small footprint That's all I ask from it Wish it came with a low profile plug but I figured out a way to make it work
Nice little unit This microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking It's fullplate size fine for heatups and smaller casserole dishes Best of all is the way it fits into a corner Yes it takes up space is not 34tiny34 but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space Controls are easy to set Haven't had a microwave in years and somebody suggested this I'm happy with it
Microwave Good unit Easy to install as I Was replacing old unit Color was as expected it to be when opened
Damaged The door has a huge dent in it Makes me suspicious of how 34new34 the product is or if it is a factory second or something returned by another purchaser
Excellent for small space This small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles It fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave It's easy to clean I'm so pleased with my decision
nice little microwave Purchased this microwave for my husband's semi truck It would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck Fought with it for several days until I decided it would work great here at home I love that it takes up so little room on my counter It's perfect for the one or two person household
Compact and Efficient Love this new Microwave fits perfectly on my small counter and is very efficient for what I need heating a cup or my heat pad The only negative I have is that the plastic cover on the bottom front panel is starting to deteriorate already and I've only had it a couple of months Otherwise love it
Looks great This microwave is simple to use and it works great At first I was a little apprehensive about the matt finish on it but once we got it installed it looks great I love it My husband and I installed itwe only needed a basic drill it took a couple of hours but we got it done
Love this microwave Love this microwave It heats food drink up fast I LOVE LOVE LOVE the compact size Counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves~so this definitely opens up some counter space It's so cute too
Touch up Just needed for a touch up But works great Will keep On hand if see another chip To be fixed
Just what I wanted This microwave isn't perfect but it's perfect for me Some folks would think it's a little loud both while running and the beeper It takes a little longer to heat than larger units but that's to be expected Those are minor issues for me It's just the right size and fits nicely in the dead space of a corner Has freed up counter top space It heats frozen food just fine and that's all I use it for If I were asked what needs improving I'd like to be able to key in the heating time rather than push the button up and down And backlighting for the buttons Overall it fits my needs
Very happy My unit arrived quickly and in good order Took just a little time for my wife and I to mount this on the wall the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc Been working perfectly can't think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top small items could fall into this area I would agree with them though in my case there's nothing above that would fall into it
Fantastic space saver I was looking for Oh my gosh This is fantastic It saved sooooo much counter space We have a family of 3 and it suits us perfectly I had one of the big stainless microwaves just took up so much counter space Only down side is you cannot type in a specific time for something to heat You press the start button and it's automatic 30 seconds press twice 60and so on now that it's been a few weeks I don't really miss the number bad I'd rather save the space
OMG This thing is a knockout We've had the big 'ol 34overtherange massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new prostyle stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it that oversized radar box had to go But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them 34compact34 they were not And then we found this Whirlpool TV set er I mean microwave Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace physics and common sense It looks just like a cute little old school TV set Imagine that A cute microwave oven But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best you can place a fullsize 1134 dinner plate inside How'd they do that?? Negatives? Nothing terrible Yes it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former 34beastmaster34 machine but as another reviewer said just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should We use our microwave for vegetables eggs liquids popcorn all of which the new cute Whirlpool TVmicrowave thingee will do just fine Takes an extra 1530 seconds because of the lower power That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is And speaking of boxes this is serious outofthebox thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave form and style perfectly matched with function It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game Bottom line? Outstanding microwave
Did the trick Made my 2005 Manufactured GE Spacemaker XL1800 work like new man there are a lot of different shells for the XL1800 depending on the year it was made There was a small round diodelike item attached with 2screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement Simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick I also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitorwhy not? It was there The whole deal took 2 12 hours start to finish including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor thanks neighbor to get help removing and remounting the microwave Lots of videos on the web to help you along the way Be patient and keep track of your screws
great product This is a great product Fixed my microwave like it was brand new I would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave
received dented unit I know I purchased a refurbished unit but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable I'm returning this unit
Love it This is a great microwave combination convection oven the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that but now my wife and I truly love it
super in a small size all the feturers of the big microwaves in a compact size the handle makes it easy to open without spilling food
Good and bad The price can't be beat and it has only the features I wanted However it's noisy and the door is difficult to open I practically have to punch the toggle or hold the unit with my left hand while I push on the switch with my right I'm hoping this gets easier over time
Best small microwave We needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space Most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is It takes up very little room plus it fits easily into a corner It has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate It's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare but it is shorter than many standard microwaves It has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine We're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity Some things take longer to cook but not by much If you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly this is not the microwave for you On the other hand if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy I definitely recommend this one We love it
Stopped working after 1 week After using the microwave for 1 week it stopped working I just sent it back and waiting for a replacement I will give sharp 1 more chance
perfect fit We needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet We struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby This one is a perfect fit I was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others so far it has worked great for our needs Plus it looks great in the space
As others have said We don't use a microwave all that much and didn't want to invest counter space in one With a teenager who is now heating things up for himself it made sense to get one and this smallfootprint model seemed to be a good fit It handles our largest dinner plate and seems to heat things well It is s little taller than it looks in the picture but it fits our family's needs quite well
Great Product We needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect Nice looking machine and tucks into a corner Would recommend to others
Dead in about a month I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell It is apparently fried which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive Not even a light I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp Very disappointing We'll see how the service from Sharp goes
A little bigeasy to use Bigger than previous Microwave larger form factor had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous Microwave Easy to use works well heats food evenly
Nice Microwave wglass turntable Chosen for it's size this microwave is pretty perfect for us We use it for simple warm ups and reheating It works great It is surprisingly very heavy Arrived very well packaged I love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back
fits the space We needed this size and the Danby works The controls are a little quirky you have to put a 34034 in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time took some getting used to The only real design flaw is that unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open you have to pull the handle on this one And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open This can be a pain But if you need this size the cooking is fine
Damaged Unit I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent but was something that I could live with rather then deal with the agony of a return After installing the unit the door would not stay closed After looking the door over I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed Totally frustrated at this point I have received a return mailing label and MRA number but this will cost me $50 to ship back The unit was not shipped in no box just corner molding foam end caps and shrink wrap 34No Original Packaging34 When it was all said and done I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response This was a headache that I really didn't need I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer
Whirlpool Microwave This microwave will fulfill my needs at this time I am well pleased with the wattage of this microwave this microwave replaced one with much less wattage
HAPPY Verry good appliance don't have any of the issues i saw posted before i bought it only one thing should warn buyers it is a green appliance so no in microwave light sorry but other than that works like a charm
Hello counter space Okay it's not the most powerful thing ever and there are a few things I would change about the design but this little thing handles all my microwave needs and has freed up a significant amount of precious counter space in my very cramped kitchen
Sharp Microwave Drawer Oven Stainless Steel This is an excellent Microwave and very big I am so very pleased with this product I think it is the favorite of my Grand kids in the kitchen
Sharp R1405 Microwave We picked this microwave primarily for its dimensions we needed one with a short height We are very pleased with this model since it is easy to use works well and is very quiet It's not loaded with features but has been a pleasure use over the last few months that we've owned it
nice microwave the microwave has work very nice a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook
Love it I had to order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged After the third one was installed it looks great and works great I got it just before Thanksgiving so I used it as an oven so I then had two ovens which came in very handy
perfect size after reading either terrible or 34hit and miss34 reviews of other small footprint microwaves with 34handle doors34 rather than 34push button34 I came across this from WhirlpoolIt had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop didn't want to use up much space it is PERFECT
Microzilla II This replaces an old Sharp Carousel we use as a second microwave and lasted 14 years My daughter called it microzilla because you had to shorten cooking times somewhat because it had so much power This one carries on the tradition
Purchased for dimensions The unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years Although none of the holes lined up the Sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop So far the unit has performed as advertised
Good enough It works It does seem a bit cheaply made but you aren't paying top dollar so you should expect that The door isn't real solid feeling so far no problems though We mounted this over stove and the fan had low and high and now only has high Not sure what happened but it still works Be aware that if this microwave gets too hot sitting over a self clean oven or cooking at high temps the fan will kick on and won't shut off Fine but we didn't know that at first and thought it was broken It's just trying to cool itself off Love the 30 second feature So many things just need short time to warm up or soften and so just pop it in press the 30 sec and it goes Easy fast Use that all the time
Still Functioning Looking Great I bought this microwave about two years ago and it still looks and functions great Have not had a single issue 
a bit clunky sounding when shutting yet works well and seems to be a good value for the price I guess I just miss the more sleek less noisy one that broke after 9 years 
Small and cute does the job This microwave is very cute there's no other word to describe it and as promised is good for small spaces It does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves I am used to and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the + sign to increase time as opposed to just typing in the number So far I have had no issues and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice
Missing parts cannot install until Samsung rectifies One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store
microwave paint This is stuff It really worked very well It save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well I highly recommend this product
Need to upgrade the shipping method I received and installed the microwave So far I am pleased with it It was damaged in shipping a dent on the top back edge This does not affect the installation or operation I noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping This needs to be fixed Better packaging and selection of carrier might help The hardware toggle bolts were cheap and just fell apart when I used them i had to use other hardware to install the unit The template is a bit off I had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit I measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 34 of an inch
Perfect microwave As all the other reviews have said the footprint of this microwave is fantastic I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave I now have so much more room on my counter The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me Worth getting used to for the extra space gained Plus it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less
Excellent product I researched many microwaves for our needs and this is the perfect unit It is my second one as the first I had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store it arrived damaged This one arrived fine well packaged for the trip It cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous It arrived when promised I would definitely buy from this seller again
New Spacemaker Good Had one about 20 yrs that was losing power New one has added features that are helpful esp sensor cooking Price is up there esp for stainless steel
best microwave yeayy I love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside it has popcorn button as well 
Two of these blew up I mean sparks then death This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months I don't recommend it at all
Great microwave during the kitchen remodel we decided to install a commercial type exhaust fan and eliminated the typical microwave location about the stove This thing is cool push a button and the drawer opens drop in your food push another button and the drawer closes
Great purchase done well Purchase was a good one Love the design of the microwave and so far it meets all my needs Being short the drawer is much more comfortable for me The process of ordering and receiving from Amazon was simple efficient and has been one of the best purchases I've made in the whole kitchen reno project Thanks Amazon
Did what it was supposed to do Did the job Great coverage Made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new Very satisfied Would purchase again
Holding Up So Far So far so good I have no complaints but it's only been in use for about 6 months If I start noticing the same wear and tear ie peeling paint on the interior I'll post an update We use this appliance several times a day everyday
Goodbye Whirlpool The beep is too loud and the door rattles Fixed the door rattle by lifting up the back with a folded 3 by 5 card Good microwave oven for the near deaf And the digital display is too bright in my studio apartment I wanted a microwave oven not a nightlight
BAD BAD BAD After the smoke has cleared from the house discovered microwave burnt out Thank God for Home Warranty Don't buy YUCK Can't believe the reviews all universally the same except mine lasted just under a year It's a crying shame a product fails so soon
Door does not always close properly Microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected Keep in mind that we do not cook in it we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers We like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the + button that adds 5 seconds at a time The only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut We need to push it up a little to get it to close Other than that it was a great purchase for us
Great price well packaged This Kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year Since tubes are now made in far east instead of by Raytheon quality as dropped I now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it It was nice to find a tube with diode which has never failed for such a great price
Great purchase This saved us from needing to buy a new microwave oven combo Easy to use We used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up
Great microwave paint Very high quality product This paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish
2 defects in less than a month Too hot to touch when cooking on stovetop Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit A few days later the light under the microwave stopped working 2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial But the good newsoptions for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times potato veg etc are fairly substantial and works efficiently HOWEVER I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop Speaking of the stove I had much better luck with GEs Caf¨¦ Dual Range Gas stove Bought at the same time No issues Works great Highly recommend stove without any hesitation Absolutely love it Wish I felt the same about the microwave
Great microwave for limited space I needed a small compact microwave This is perfect if you have limited counter space The depth is good It will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave This is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side The control buttons are simple but intuitive
Very nice parts I ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days My turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave I'm very easy removed old engine and put new one Quality product and parts was new Highly recommended this seller
Did not work at all Twice I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function I was so happy to find this product at Amazon The first one arrived last week but I had to return it next day It made clicking noise when I closed the door It also make some noises when I push 34Start34 button The second one I received today and connect set up clock and start with a cup of water to make sure it works I felt bad returning the same product twice This time I called Whirlpool customer service The personnel told me the information she has is the same 34product guide34 which comes with the product
Great little unit Love this little microwave It is the perfect size holds just a dinner plate and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up 12x month or steaming vegetables so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use
none functioning microwave Microwave didn't work when I received it It was really disappointing It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it
DOES THE JOB DESCRIPTION 62 Can be mounted in a 2434 wide X 1234 deep space Not intended to be installed above a range standard ranges are 3034 wide does not include a builtin hood for use above a range 62 Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute place it in the microwave and press 34134 That's all 62 Well built albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II 62 Quieter than my old Spacemaker IIalthough that's no big deal 62 The turntable is a nice addition my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable but reduces the total space available unless you turn the turntable off 62 Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II Plus popcorn 34beverage34 34reheat34 34chickenfish34 34potato34 and 34vegetable34 buttons which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing Other new buttons are 34delay start34 34reminder34 34turntable onoff34 and 34add 30 sec34 The 34add 30 sec34 works on its own you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time 30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee or heating some pastries There is a child lockout but without a dedicated button UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION 62 The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases 62 The microwave hangs from four ~1 1434long machine screws which are inserted from above from inside the cabinet above If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1234 thick then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1234 62 Hypothetically you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store and 4 big washers eg 234 in diameter However the installation kit is probably easier 62 If you use the template double check the logic and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet That is the front holes should be approximately 3 1434 back from the front of the closed doors The door of the microwave needs an extra 1834 on the left in order to open fully and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave If there is an obstruction on the left side such as wall cabinet or refrigerator you may wish to shift the holes 1434 to the right if you can UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT 62 If this is an new undercounter installation or the space between the front and back screw holes inside the cabinet above the microwave is not ~6 1434 then you need GE part WX4A019 [[ASINB001H815TO GE Part Number WX4A019 UNDER CAB MT]] If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1434 between the front and back holes then you probably do NOT need an installation kit IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3434 62 I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23year old Spacemaker II But neither the holes backing plate nor the screws were the same 62 The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker 62 The lateral spacing sidetoside between the screw holes is the same 19 153234 for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker 62 But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same the new spacing is 6 1434 62So if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes measure 6 1434 back from the center of the front hole and drill the new hole there 62 The screws seem to be very similar but a slightly different diameter or pitch perhaps they are metric Hypothetically you could drill new holes in the old backing plate or use washers instead of the backing plate and find screws the right size and length but I decided to purchase the new kit instead BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN 62 My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges lightning I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset I've had the same experience with several other appliances 62 Even refrigerators and clothes driers have builtin computers these days If any electric appliance is not working properly unplug it and leave it unplugged a while For some reason perhaps large capacitors in the circuit big appliances usually need hours to reset RELIABILITY If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years my old Spacemaker was still working when I 34took it out of service34 After 23 years of daily use some of the white finish was turning yellow there were patches of rust inside and the door switch which turns the light on and off was erratic IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE keep the tray from your old microwave 62 The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnton spills which may promote rust in the future 62 I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole or many small containers I often warm two 1234 diameter full plates of foodI use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap 62 If you use the tray lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive then place the glass tray in the bottom GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking so the key to cooking many items especially vegies is to generate and hold that steam 62 If you are warming bread wrap it in a towel It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be If the bread is rock hard slightly dampen the towel and use halfpowerthe warm bread will be soft and fresh Heat only briefly andor at reduced power 62 You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of cornonthecob in a microwave if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel 62 Rinse vegetables before you cook themthat washes off any pesticides etc and the extra water will produce extra steam If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to rehydrate them 62 It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave because the excess formation of steam

awesome deal fits perfect and works great never thought I would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look
Good microwave but a little expensive for what you get This is a good microwave that fits well in the corner of the kitchen It fits a full size dinner plate
Works well bad reviews might have been a bad batch or quality control issue The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch This microwave has worked great for us Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space I really like the one touch timer feature It seems to be well built Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013 I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units
only had a short time only one I could find to fit in space couldn't use all the others because once installed was unable to open door because it is next to an extended wall I hunted all over for a microwave that the door hinge was about an inch from side
Best purchase this year This microwave works well and is efficient It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance Would not hesitate to purchase again
Not compact I got this because it was touted as a minimicrowave Of course I am capable of reading the dimensions which I did but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave It simply won't work with my limited counterspace I don't know how well it works because after trying it in various spots I put it right back in the box BTW it is $30 to send back so make sure you want it before you order
Door seems not very stable I like this microwave EXCEPT the door is NOT always close right as you close it it's almost as if it was installed a bit lower than it needs to be to close securely The family is ALWAYS complaining about it Also for the size of this thing I thought it would be a tiny bit taller INSIDE Our freezer makes icecream VERY HARD so we 'nuke' it for maybe a minute to get it softer before serving the round icecream container cannot fit upright in it Some cups do not fit either The PLUS side of this tho is that it DOES fit snugly into a corner THAT is the only thing that sells it in my opinion I have NO IDEA WHY it is so big bulky for the size it actually IS on the inside? There is a solid 534 of 'bulk' at the bottom another 334 at the top and about 6 3434 of height INSIDE and that does NOT include the plate roller so you TRULY ONLY HAVE a microwave that is 5 34 INCHES tall inside The PLATE within is an 1134 plate but it is very close to the edge ALSO the bottom roller that holds the plate in place is in TWO PARTS rather than ONE If this roller gets off the other piece it makes a rattling noise makes you think there is something very wrong with it We only use a microwave for warming things reheating pizza a cup of coffee etc and this does that job very well however for $150 I would have absolutely RETURNED IT had I not lived on an island in Alaska where the shipping would have KILLED me 
Perfect size for small space This little giant is great for small spaces It is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves I am very happy with purchase
Looks great but longevity poor This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product
Worked 100% This kit is just what I needed My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install Now it works like new again There are dangers of electric shock so do your research Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go
I'm not satisfy I received on time but with damage on the door and left side and with out grillI'm not so happy
Ge Microwave oven magnetron and diode kit The four fixed screws on the unit does not line up with the existing hole of the microwave so i had to zip tie it down they needed to be at the 12 and 6 o`clock position for me to bolt it down but it works great
Came damaged Box was not crushed but top venting cover was dented and cracked I used the old one from the same model that needed to be replaced as to avoid all of the return BS
TURNTABLE DOES NOT WORK While I love the shape of the microwave it does fit perfectly in a corner the turntable is defective and does not turn Upon removing the packaging I immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok walked off a minute and when I returned the water was very hot I thought eveyrthing was ok so I threw the packaging away A few days later I put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that's when I noticed the turntable was not turning I opened the door checked the wheels it revolves on replaced the glass gave the glass a little turn and still nothing I tried even placing things of different weights on it sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop So buyers beware I would not purchase this item
Corner microwave This met our requirements for a space saving microwave We would recommend it to any one with limited counter space
Bad choice It worked for three weeks and now it won't start Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back What a pain
Good simple microwave It is a basic microwave and so far working very well It fit perfect over our oven range My husband and his friend's help needed for taking old one out and setting this microwave up Door feels very light we are used to the metal one so we get gentle on it
Great style and size but it is a little deep for where I have it Beautiful and stylish Easy to use with sensitive touch screen
I love it When ordering cabinet for microwave I had no clue that Sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly It looks so great and works beautifully
Door opening button broke GE won't fix I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews We bought this because it fit our space but the door button broke The door won't open when the button is pushed it just unlatches and you have to pry it open What's worse the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine He refused to replace anything
Great Microwave works and looks FANTASTIC We got it the same day our cabinets were being installed We were worried about it not working since this was our first online purchase of such a high priced item Let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed FANTASTIC it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens We installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop No more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out This is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen
More powerful than expected Bought this for a small kitchen it fits nicely in the corner and works great Seems to be wellmade Although it is lower wattage I have not had to significantly increase the cooking time and I can fit a plate or even cookreheat in a round 2qt dish The beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints
It is what is This product fits into a small corner counter space that I have and it 34looks34 nicebut truth be told I could have saved money and bought a small rectangular MW and put it on the same counter although it wouldn't have looked quite as nice as this one does
Great Product The ceiling of my microwave was a disaster Paint was peeling all over it This product did the trick Make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one
Perfect for my RV Bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my RV I had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me The unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well Great item at a great price Enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks
Kind of hard to LOVE a microwave but I have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 56 weeks I researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one The availability and price here on Amazon beat my local big box stores and chains Installation appeared easy for my contractors There are options to allow venting outside either behind or above the microwave not so clear from product description but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage not compatible with local code The bells and whistles are amazing with our kids ready to show us how it works right after we stop the clock blinking on our VCR
It works Had large amount of rust under rotating plate in GE microwave Surface prep is important I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had I ended up using a 134 metal paint scraper to remove all paintrust down to base metal in the damaged area this worked very well Then sanded smooth Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol Masked off area to be painted Ensure adequate ventilation when painting I applied mutliple coats 2 months of usage thus far looks great holding up great
Micro paint I bought a used micro that works great but needed a little 34tweaking34 for paint touch p inside This did the job
I love it It is so nice it works is small has a wonderful shape it is an acquisition for my kitchen I recommend it
Convection oven still not working SEPTEMBER 13 2013 over one month after delivery AND STILL NOT USABLE GETTING UPSET  THE RATING REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT WORKING YET So I can't be sure that it will The unit was delivered and it is what I wanted because it is exactly like the one I had for 14 years newer model of course but it has not been working as it should I wonder if the tech will really getting it to work correctly Waiting now for parts to fix the oven portion of the unit The tech tells that the microwave portion only cooks on the sides and the center does not get the ray to cook the food How can that be possible?? Anyway here I am one full month after purchasing the oven and can't use it I still will be happy if they get it to work properly Love the fact that the color is not bisque thankfully it is almond like the previous one although the bottom of this one is white why??? Was it refurbished???? Original bottom damaged ???? Will never know
The Perfect Repair For A Rusty Microwave oven After following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven I'm happy I had found this product Now I don't have to pay a costly repair bill
Perfect I needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space This item fits the bill perfectly It fits neatly into a corner of my countertop in no way dominates the area and functions way beyond what I expected If you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it Don't hesitate to purchase it Highly recommended
UPS Strikes Again After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week I opted to upgrade to this GE model The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment For me UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon As to the GE microwave it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents Not exactly a 30000 foot drop but enough to render it unusable If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving installing and using an overtherange microwave oven I'll be sure to review its salient points Oh and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their nameand you have to return the item you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost Amazon cannot reimburse for it you MUST wait for the vender Me? I'm still waiting for my $500 Caveat Emptor September 13 Update Item arrived back at the vender today I'm still waiting for my $500
This is a good choice for a simple over the oven micowave The microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides It's a very simple micowave that does it's core job well which is exactly what I wanted I didn't need all of the advanced features cooking presets and autooptions that the more expensive microwaves come with I installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn't work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after
dented in several places the items was shipped handled by UPS the microwave was bent in several places on the bottom it was hard to tell if it was that way before packing or done during shipping box was damaged as well had we not been working on a deadline for a house showing I would have sent it back for an exchange but no time it appears work just fine and the dents don't show thanks to the shelf it was placed on I would expect a discount based on the damaged product we had no choice but to keep I have photos if needed
microwave cavity paint i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed the product worked great the inside of my microwave looks brand new
good concept This is a great design concept It gives you more counter space I was worried about it making soup spill with jerky loading but I haven't found that to be a problem The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the interface is a bit clumsy For pretty much everything it requires too many key strokes to get it doing what you want It's like the old days of operating a VCR way too complicated It's like you have to keep the manual out on the counter if you want to do anything other than run if for 1 2 or 3 minutes defrosting = difficult timer = difficult resetting the clock = difficult In summary as long as your key objective is to get the microwave off of the counter and you only plan on using it to reheat things at max heat then you will love it
Fixed it As advertised Easy to replace Not really much more to say bought a replacement part and it worked Saved the money for a new microwave
Good convectionmicrowave functionality We used the Dacor labelled version of this aplliance for 10 years before it gave out Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor at half the price So we ordered this one but returned it immediately because it had dents so obviously had been dropped and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is 850 watts was just fine for us for 10 years Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long? And the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will Anyway I think this is a pretty good product particularly if you use the convection function a lot One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion The exhaust then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean If we had done those things our old Dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer We considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease
love it GREAT SMALL SIZE looks good fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace and works very well
Cheaply Made Thin metal foil surface piece peeled off almost immediately Glued back on but will probably happen again in other places Door is flimsy and bends easily so it requires a careful and firm slam to shut properly or the latch doesn't catch and it won't operate Same with closing after use or light won't go out For the wear and tear I imagine that the latch is what is going to finally break first This is the first truly disappointing major brand appliance that I have bought and it was not the low end model We got GE Profile to match our other kitchen appliances We will be needing a new dishwasher soon This is enough to make us change brands
microwave have owned Sharps in past this fit perfectly above stove No alterations no fuss Works great looks great would recomend
Exactly what I hoped it would be I love it I have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this little microwave is exactly what I needed It works as well as any other microwave I have owned Very happy
Very Poor Quality Control at GE Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck They say third time is a charm We'll see
cutest microwave ever I receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen We have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny works great and a spectacular space saver Highly recommended
microwave packaging was not strong enough The microwave was dented when removed from packaging Since the dent was in the back and didn't interfere with installation I didn't send it back
nice a little bulkier than I expected bigger than the old one I got in the 1990's but fits on the counter
Terrible Customer Service 30% restocking fee We purchased this microwave and then realized that 2 cu ft is WAY too big for a family of three We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping fair enough but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee This is absurd Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box we simply opened the top and then reclosed it 30% seems like usury to me Frankly I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30% what are they doing just trashing returns? Anyway even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE and reward these unfair business practices We own a business and we expect to be treated as consumers the same way we treat our customers that simply isn't happening here
Unique Microwave Fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn't take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace
turntable this was exactly the one I needed I wasn't sure I would be able to find the one I needed but I did and loved the fact I received it sooner than expected
perfect for a small kitchen fits in the corner under upper cabinets perfectly Only 750 watts but just fine for reheating left overs etc I like that the 34controls34 are under the door so that the turntable sits a little higher Also something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave as the door opens a few inches above the counter top I have only had the microwave for a month but no problems at all I am very happy with my purchase
works great for us This microwave has many good features and fit great into our overthecounter space in our kitchen It was easy to install and has been very reliable GE makes good products but don't expect it to last forever We replaced our old GE microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one The primary reason I bought another GE Spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave I did not want to have to replace my cabinets to have a different sized microwave
Sharp R1874 11CubicFoot 850Watt OverTheRange Convection Microwave We gave this to my daughter for her birthday Her husband installed it over their range She loves the convenience of both another oven and the option of a microwave the convection is large enough for a big baked chicken
Best Decision We were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged It defrosts without cooking won't burn popcorn can soften butter without melting and of course looks amazing Its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install If I had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages Still worth it and would still recommend it
Very very happy with this I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price I'll just run through the pros as I see them 1 It's unique Every other microwave I've ever seen with the exception of the Sharp HalfPint looks pretty much the same a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different and in a good way Don't worry about the lack of a keypad the controls are a nobrainer When you unbox it and see the rounded back you know you've bought something different from the norm 2 It's big inside Bigger than my old GE compact for round things and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave I have yet to try it with popcorn manual says limit it to the 175 ounce size 3 It's powerful 130 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one Good enough for me 4 The LED display is blue Very cool in my opinion 5 The interior light goes on when you open the door Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking 6 You can use the timer and cook simultaneously Pretty standard but some don't Also you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or no need to stop and reset And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want 7 No door release button You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull And it feels solid when you shut it 8 The reminder tone shuts off Yes it reminds you when you forget to pull something out but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time 9 Limited featuresThe only special features are defrost reheat popcorn and power level 100% 75% 50% 25% and the powersaving 0% I've never used anything more 10 I'm running out of ideas but to make a nice round 10 I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window This gives it a kind of windowbox look that I like a lot Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave You won't regret it NOTE The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked Further investigation revealed the protective film which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath
Replaced Previous Version We ordered this to replace the previous version Style is slightly different It does not seem as sturdy as the last one and it didn't last as long we would have expected a semipremium appliance line to last We use it as built in which was fine for the first one but this door is not conducive to built in configurations The new black trim is okay So far it works fine
More than I expected Many more features than advertised Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up
Really great Great little microwave It's the perfect size It's a little underpowered so a add 30 secs to most cooking times Small footprint and looks great in the kitchen
Perfect Fit I got this to save counterspace and the fact I only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn It performs these functions perfectly It may not have the most power but if another 3060 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off you have bigger problems than this microwave
Best Microwave that I've owned I needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top and I couldn't find anything smaller than a 07 Cu Ft in any store Since this one had so many good reviews I decided to give it a try It not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter but it is also the best microwave I've ever owned It fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size and it heats up very quickly I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen
Small but so great This little microwave fits into the corner We have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience If you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker so keep that in mind when deciding
Awesome microwave This is perfect for one plate It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey but honesty who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space I got one for my mom too and she loves it She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts it's 750 just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes
Choose Panasonic instead Door doesn't always close right and although it is practically new it sounds like it is dying Would not purchase again
42016 update  3 yr lifespan  nice small microwave I loved this microwave's size and shape but in the last month 42016 I had two sparking incidents luckily I was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly I just threw it out Today I was looking online to see when I bought it April 2013 and if anyone else had reported similar issues  I see that there are similar reviews so don't think Ill buy another even tho I like the size and shape  UPDATED 42016 it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap this looks nice and works great a keeper
Worked for 1 month I loved the small size of this microwave but the power was lacking Furthermore after we had this unit for 1 month it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking We returned this product
Works as promised Same model that we had before with some cosmetic changes The old one died after 6 years Reviews placed it at over $160 for repair Bought the old one because it fits on shelf over the stove Bought the new one for the same reason Hope we get at least 6 years out of it
Pretty good for a little guy The only thing I would chande is the push handle Sometimes it diesn't work the first time and it feels like it sticks Otherwise a good product and good value
Microwave is great but I found it cheaper at Lowe's by $15000 Too late now it's too cumbersome to return It pays to shop around
I luv this microwave This is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen The domed shape works great on my smaller counter top Would recommend it
Not Pleased First time around I'll try a second time My wife wanted a smaller microwave for the counter top This was perfect at least for 28 days On the 28th day all the controls appeared to work but the unit no longer heated Amazon's return policy was to issue a refund I wanted it fixed so I contacted Whirlpool directly They stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that I would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced It's now one week later no response from Whirlpool and I can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago I decided to contact Amazon about the issue Amazon is sending me a return label and issuing a refund I should have done THIS in the first place and never bothered with Whirlpool I just ordered my SECOND unit from Amazon I'm hoping this one will last longer than 28 days I would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed now only 3 If the second one fails I'll drop it to 1 or zero stars I give Amazon 5 stars for service on this item Joe
Great product Love that it is off the counter large and works well I originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems An electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it and without question we bought the same one
Just what I needed A similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a nonadjustable shelveframe above the counter top Searched websites and found what I wanted then searched Amazon and found one with the best price @ Abe's of Maine Quick delivery and the packagingcrating was extraordinary Would buy product again and would buy from Abe's of Maine again
Great for small spaces I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep It heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well
what we needed I needed a little oven that fit in the corner For size and convenience it works well I have found that I need to leave what ever I am cooking in the oven a little bit longer But it works well and no complaints about operation
great product Fits perfectly in our countertop CORNER Fits in the 34dead space34 there It's on the small side but it is perfect for our needs
spacesaver I have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave I was looking for a space saver microwave and I found it It is large enough to handle anything my old microwave could do like day to day tasks of reheating baking potatoes and other small food items
Just what a microwave should be Small Exactly what I wanted It's the perfect fit Works just fine Bye bye bulky hand me down I'm handing you down lol
Unit is Top of the line Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options Just getting used to it Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the itemI would recommend this item
I love the microwave It met all my needs regarding space looks like a TV works well and you don't need a college degree to operate Very pleased with this products Little pricey but worth it
Not the specified dimensions This Spacemaker microwave is 3434 deeper than in the specifications This is the difference between fitting and not fitting in a 1234 deep cabinet
works great easy to use I had a rust spot inside my microwave oven Sanded it down put on two coats of paint fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back
excellent I like this microwave it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen but it is powerful It is a good combination of quality and good design Expensive but worth it
Great microwave easy to install and a space saver Looks great works great Took less than an hour to install Was a little overwhelmed with instructions but was easier to install than originally thought Looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen I would recommend this product to anyone
It's a space saver It's rather small on the outside and just big enough on the inside Everyone who comes over thinks it's a TV
Good Quality Very good product quality this is all I expected to get I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that
Love this Perfect for a small kitchen From the moment I took it out of the box it looked beautiful fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great I put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass I did not want my old LARGE white microwave oven taking up one entire wall I don't use the microwave that much so this is perfect It's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn AND you want style and beauty this is it
Decent This microwave is fine It is not great It takes three and a half minutes to warm up a cup of coffee but since that is its only function on our counter it is doing its job just slower than some of the more powerful ones Its size is definitely a plus and fits in a wee corner Its not having more programable numbers is annoying as one has to hold the button as the time counts up incrementally but for a cup warmer it will do
Well built product I purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model $200+ from WilliamsSonomo and this Whirlpool is a much better machine The build quality is excellent and the veritcalness of it saves space on the counter Had to return the WilliamsSonoma model The Whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls At first I missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad However after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds Super product that I would buy again and it looks cool
Amazing We love this microwave It looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was Our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything including our largest dinner plates Heating will require an additional 2030 seconds but definitely worth the wait Can't say enough about how cool it looks
Glad GE makes this size microwave Like other reviewers I had to purchase this particular GE Spacemaker microwave because it was the only larger one that fit into the existing builtin cabinet in our kitchen Other manufacturers are missing the boat if they think everyone wants or needs a huge countertop or abovetherange microwave or a teensy weensy underpowered microwave There was no need for the industry to completely change size standards for countertop models That said I've only had this microwave a few weeks so far so good I like its features and performance It's a bit smaller inside than our previous full size GE microwave The previous GE fit perfectly in our microwave cabinet but its magnetron went out in a scary way after about 6 years of use So far only drawback to new microwave is that the instructions say to keep the front of the microwave 3 inches back from edge of countertop so it won't tip over when the door is open Not enough space to do that in our builtin microwave cabinet so have to be careful not to inadvertently put weight on the open door with my hand or the whole appliance starts to tip forward Don't recollect seeing that information in the description of this product on Amazon so please be aware
Samsung microwave I like the looks the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel We have multiple Samsung products All exceed our expectations of their products There are NO other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons
Bargain at the price Had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years 2 GE and 3 Samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house vacation condo and GF's house Bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5 Hope to have the same luck with this one
Great ovenmicro Easy to install user friendly instructions Came in good condition Manual very easy to understand and use microoven Cooks in 12 the time when using fast back Really good product
We Like This Product This is a good product It replaced our previous Profile Spacemaker II model which lasted about ten years We're not exotic microwave users and choose the Reheat feature 99% of the time The new model works well although my wife thinks our previous model had a hotter reheat temperature because we more frequently have to press the reheat button a second time with the new model We also find the location of the ClearOff button confusing and sometimes fumble around looking for it It should have been placed in an easier to find location like on the top or bottom corner We like the turntable which our previous model didn't have and think it helps heat the food more uniformly Overall we're pleased with this product
Love this microwave Love this microwave Product was Easy to install and easier to operate The first one we ordered came damaged The process to return item was a piece of cake The second one came from a different company and was packaged much much better We used to have our microwave sitting on the counter We remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave We will NEVER go back to any other microwave Well worth the price Love Love Love this product
Good buy good value This was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodelIt is quite roomy I particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features
Updated Sharp over the range microwave Fits perfectly in previous Sharp model space Heating seems the same as the previous model although this one states 850 watts and the old one said 1100 watts Exhaust does not work as well as the other model Fan seems to work same on low and high speed no difference in sound or intensity of fan sound One would think the low would seem quieter
Only ok We needed a small microwave for a small space and this fits perfectly but very low power takes a long time not tall enough for many things have to transfer contents to shorter vessels extremely loud beeping that can't be turned off
Replaced the same model bought 6 years ago Bought this model to replace the one bought thru Amazon 6 years ago It just died abruptly thought it was a fuse but if there was one couldn't locate it Buying the same model made installation a snap Just hope this one lasts longer
Just what we wanted to replace our failed unit of 23 yrs Install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit Only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good
Best Ever this is the best Microwave I have ever had Love the size and the program buttonsare so nice I use the Bake Potato button all the time
Good Choice Works as advertised Easy to follow installation instructions and cooks great Of course the holes from my old 'Ewave' did not line up with this model
Perfect replacement for a 30 inch Thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find But that was the only thing I could use in the cabinetry in our Winnebago RV It's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too We like it's added features oer the older unit we had It decided to only run on high
Does not perform like it should for this price This microwave does not heat as quickly or as hot as we would like It has some great features but its performance is just not up to par for the price
Great for the price I spent hundreds more for another 34Name34 brand and this one is as good Cant beat this for the price I paid
I like it I like the look the ease of cleaning and the fact that it does everything I need a microwave to do without taking up much countertop space The only drawback is that the interior is so small I sometimes 34bump34 coffee cups trying to put them in for reheating spilling liquid that drips straight down to the control panel After having a full size microwave this one takes some getting adjusting on my part I gave it 4 stars because I can't heat pancake syrup in it the bottles are too tall All other things I use it for such as making popcorn melting butter reheating leftovers etc are just fine
Great As described by Phil it is very easy to install A tip as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit After you install the new motor flip the door you cut out over and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up Use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again
Planning ahead I currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space I have Bought this one again as a spare Just in case and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time Very happy with this 800W model Does my jobs  It is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house Too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box
works well not liking the push button door release Had 6 months It works fine as a microwave but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want Window is hard to see the food through and it always fogs up making it even harder I like the favorites program but they should build in an automatic delay between stages This is because if you program 1 min at high and 1 min at 50% you actually get about 115 straight high A third stage would also be nice I don't like the push button door latch It takes a lot of effort and if it gets dirty is hard to clean because it pushes in 14 inch without any effort making wiping it hard It should have s simple handle
Perfect for a craft room I expected this microwave oven to be smaller than it is I was hoping for a small microwave to go in the craft room for my wife because she spends a lot of time in there and her coffee often goes cold and instead of having to get up and leave her work she can reach over and reheat her coffee I didn't want something that takes up a lot of space Well this is about as small as I've seen but I thought there were smaller ones We don't have a lot of extra space so we bought this one It works fine I personally don't like the bright blue LED clock on the front but my wife doesn't mind It does what it's supposed to
It's okay I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great I only use for reheating or defrosting so it is fine for that Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in itso I use smaller plates for reheating I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it It DOES have it's own popcorn button
GREAT PRICE The Motor fit perfect works great price was excellent Was much cheaper than new microwave A A A A plus
pem31 microwave All purchase and shipping activities were fine Microwave door on this model not well designed It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model Wish I knew that before purchasing
Great microwave Plus I've had this microwave installed for about 4 months now and I really like it It cooks evenly and in a predictable waymuch better than the traditional turntable models The coolness factor is high and its easy for the kids to use I love how it fits in with my new kitchen Minus  it's pricey for a microwave Considering the price I expected it to have a few more quick features like a 30 second reheat button it will do 1 min The openclose mechanism is noisy and closes with a 34clunk34  The special cooking features are complicated to program so I have yet to use them Summary It was worth the splurge
too early to rate the microwave It is installed it heatscooks still after 4 days wife is disappointed in appearance but it looks ok to me
Great Microwave I bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that I bought the same one for my sister I like it very much Its a perfect size easy to use has a button for baking potatoes and other items I recommend it very highly
Problems have started Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error the unit has already started acting funny The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time This AM while making oat meal for my daughter I opened the unit and it was dead No light like it was unplugged Closed and the display listed all 0's across Opened door again no light After a few times the light went on and unit was operational Subsequently I did do the stopenter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s model and 110512A which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party ieSamsung Lowes? and has been pawning them off as new here I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves if not new unit for me
works great VERY smelly Be sure to scrape all rust out with steel wool paint scraper whatever it takes The directions were minimalI googled for more information
Great Microwave A very compact beautiful and sleek microwave Saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate
Was Great what they showed is what we got This was to replace a bad microwave in one of our condo's kitchen it fit perfectly and looks good Thank You
Better than I expected If you're looking for a space saver this is the microwave for you If fits so well in the corner of the counter top and I have twice the space I had when my old bulky clunker was still on the counter I haven't found a plate yet that doesn't fit in the microwave and only one conatiner was too tall to fit but even that wasn't criticaljust used another container The power is suffiecient for warming and cooking most foods I do wish it had a few more watts around 1000 would be perfect Over all the compromise in power is well worth the additional space Controls are very simple although I do wish I could increase the time in more than 30 second increments Service was terrific The first unit arrived damaged by the shipper Replacement was fast and problem free
Just Installed it in a new kitchen Looks great But you have to press Open and Close buttons to open and close drawer Very delicate product It is uncomfortable unpractical to press these buttons everytime I am sure they will go bad very soon I will not suggest anybody to purchase this product
Tiny Perfection Fits a cup of coffee dinner plate and popcorn What else do you need? Fits perfect in my cabinet out of site
Sharp Microwave Turntable Motor RMOTDA252WRZZ This product fit and worked as expected For anyone wondering about how to install there is a pattern of holes drilled in the bottom of the microwave around the turntable motor To get to the motor gently cut the metal between the holes to create a little door Open the door remove 2 screws then the motor unplug old motor plug in new one drop new motor into hole put 2 screws back You're probably supposed to throw the 34door34 away but I bent mine back in there Flip microwave over and plug it in put turntable spindle back on and try it out I recommend doing this out of sight of your spousal unit and then take about 30 minutes to goof off Then return microwave to spousal unit telling them what an arduous task it was but how you figured it out and saved the family $10000 Should be good for at least a hug or a kiss or WHATEVER
Exactly what I needed This microwave works well I wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders It does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter I am very pleased
Really looks great Looks and works great so far the vent is really nice and powerful too a bit loud when you set it at the highest but sure does work
Whirlpool Wouldn't work Have to return it The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door There is no problem
Didn't work Received it and installed it The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part magnitron It turned out to be something else I can't remember what so they have to order that I am still waiting Fortunately my old microwave Amana still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components from Korea Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on
The best available When our old Sharp 34over the range34 started to die 14 years of service and the display had become very dim and door starting to crack with quite large chips falling off we decided it had to be replaced Finding an over range gas with convection and a good extractor fan proved difficult and so we decided on this Sharp product At 71 lbs and with different mounting points from it's predecessor it was a difficult installation task could not have been done by one person on their own Once in place however it is the greatest It is better designed than the one before with 2 extractor inlets placed to handle the heat from the gas range very well a large ceramic turntable that is easy to clean PLUS it can be selected to 34not rotate34 which permits bigger dishes to be used as needed Best of all it has a 34keep warm34 feature that allows warming serving plates as well as keeping unserved food ready for 34seconds34 without the whole reheat cycle Great product would have given 5 stars but for the physical difficulty of installation in fairness that would have probably been much the same for any brand
Bad Product Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year
New microwave We love this new appliance Just a few days before Thanksgiving our old one died I purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches Returned that one and went online and found this one at almost $10000 less than what my local dealer could get it for me He agreed that I should order thru Amazon and not only did I receive it in less than a week it fit looks great and works perfectly
Perfect size for table top microwave Simple to use spacious and compact  Been looking for a microwave like this for a while The only drawback is it looks a bit like a old TV on the kitchen counter
Did the job The microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable I sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint I did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well There's a spot that looks like I didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to redo it It's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month
Difficult to Open The push latch for the door is very tricky Sometimes it opens the door at once Mostly it takes repeated efforts
NO CHOICE IN PURCHASING ADEQUATE PRODUCT This is the only microwave made that fits into my preconstructed custom cabinet space My first one lasted 8 years When it wouldn't turn off I ordered a new one The first one sent to me would not turn on Seems like something was wrong with the key pad GE's faultnot the distributor or Amazon Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent
Tiny treasure I live in a small house 400 sf so I don't have much room for anything This may be too soon for a review as I just received the microwave y'day but so far it's just perfect I love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side as my microwave cubby is only 165 inches wide I like the style and the easy setup as well It's perfect for an apartment dorm room or office kitchen One thing to note on the inside left wall if you're facing the microwave there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel and since it looks like it could possibly be removed I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification Long story short don't remove the panel it's supposed to be there Other than that momentary confusion I'm really happy with this product
Great Item Item was what was advertised in condition advertised and delivered on time That's all you can ask of a supplier You must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint Takes a lot of sanding and preparing but the result of spraying even coats is great
Very nice design I bought this microwave almost a year ago Love it Quality is good enough I do not use it too often I really in love with the design
Nice This is a really nice little microwave Just what I was looking for No complaints It was shipped quickly by the supplier too The controls are simple and elegant and the surfaces are easy to clean I would buy it again
Fast shipment So far so good Replaced a Samsung and the existing bracket worked Much quieter than the one replaced My wife loves the meltsoften function
Good Microwave I have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions but so far it seems like a good machine
I ordered these motors to power a miniature barber pole project they work great Motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good
Mr Johnny Warren This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products
Affordable Quality This is the second Sharp R1405 Over the Range Microwave I have owned The first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service So I was thrilled when I found the same model still being produced I snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90% of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove Not only thatThe price was about $200 or $300 less than comparable over the range microwaves An excellent product that gets the job doneI highly recommend it
Sharp Microwave Turntable For some strange reason my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half I didn't have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an Amazon vendor The order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again We are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product
Perfect When the turntable on my Sharp microwave stopped turning I went on line to find a substitute Some years ago I had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave Simple device Works by winding it up much like an old fashioned alarm clock After Googling turntable I came upon this little motor and thought 34Why not?34 I can do this I know nothing about electronics so I realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix I might destroy it but it wasn't working anyway so I decided to gamble and order the part I very carefully opened up the microwave after disconnecting it from the power and located the motor that turned the turntable It was simple fairly intuitive to remove and replace and for a very small amount of money I fixed the microwave I've had this microwave for seven plus years and now I expect to get another seven very possibly more Overall one of my best buys on Amazon
different photo in ad Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step The actually ad is different than the actual product
Samsung Microwave Very attractive and functional microwave that was easy to install as a replacement for a GE microwave that no longer worked
Big Well Built Needed a new stainless steel microwave Works well nice and big It is only stainless on the front black everywhere else Works well so far
GE Profile Microwave This is an excellent product It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use Its not only nice looking but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor
met my expectations Used this microwave as a builtin I had a specific width opening in some shelving and wanted the most cu ft and features in this width Only been using it for a couple weeks however it has met my expectations The body of this unit is black so if you are looking for an all stainless for countertop use this would not be the one
This microwave SUCKS This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave Well how I said I purchased it in April but didn't install it until the beginning of August The delivery was fast but when I reccieved it two of the back corners were dented but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it It is now October and it has gone out on me I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out It turned off just like that It never turned back on I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty Well it is under warranty but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave whether it's her or some other place Save yourselves time money and dissapointment Also do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull I only give it one star because I have to give it a 15 or else I would give it a 0
My Favorite Microwave This is the third model of this microwave I have bought Since I do a lot of cooking with my microwave I enjoy all the features this one has particularly the 34baked potato34 and 34sensor reheat34 functions Not only was I overjoyed to find the exact model I saved over $70 on my replacement I was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order
Not like they used to make I purchased this product because our last Spacesaver finally bit the dust after almost 20 years Not the same quality product as previously produced Door sticks popcorn button doesn't always spin turntable as indicated in manual
750 watts and beautiful This Whirlpool WMC2005YW 05 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had We sold our house where we had a builtin micro and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small Haier The only thing good about the Haier was it was small so when it blew out we had to go small again I totally counted on the reviews for this micro and thank you everybody you are so right I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute just nestled into that small space The best part is that it really works well We feared making popcorn which the Haier never and I mean never did well Always burnt no matter what we tried This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 12 minutes We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly There is a 30 second button start stop and a clock that also doubles as a timer We have never used the auto buttons I would buy this again in a minute
fits well in small spaces fits well on countertop in small space Works very well warming and reheating Works better that other microwave that was much bigger
Read this Then install Everything is great Just a warning Double check the template used for the upper cabinet Actually check it against the unit In my case I replaced an older Maytag so I had two existing holes in my cabinet Then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up I superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up So I did not make a mistake The Template was off No real big deal but now I have six holes Double check the holes Unit is great Previous unit did not vent out of the house This one I installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor This Microwave gives you three optionsVent backvent from the top or recirculate I do not reccomend recirculating If you can vent this unit or any unit always vent I had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues like wires that I had to reroute etc but I knew that when it was over I would be smiling and I am For the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the VENT is the Greatest
oven I am very satified with this microwave although I was surprised when I saw two small dents on the door This of course does not in anyway hamper the workings I would recommend this product for its efficiency
Worried how long it will hold up I needed a small microwave for my small kitchen and this one fits the bill Why aren't there more small appliances out there? Oh right we live in the US where bigger is supposedly better Anyway this microwave has performed fine so far powerful enough for reheating leftovers in a timely manner It doesn't heat very evenly but in my experience most microwaves don't If it's soup no problem just stir If it's a frozen burrito the ends will be bubbling while the middle is still frozen Annoying However the biggest complaint after having this microwave for just one month is that there is a thin layer of plastic over the control buttons and it is already scratched and peeling off in some places Makes me concerned about the overall quality of this thing
Perfect for a small space My old microwave dating back to the mid90s finally bit the dust I was worried that I wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it but this one fits the bill It is small but big enough for the needs of our 3person household I find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves and this one offers about the same height as a regular one It's not as powerful as some of the fullsized microwaves but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint It's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive The rounded back works well for our needs as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit After a few months of use I'm quite pleased with this purchase
Small but Mightly I purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space Since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn this microwave is perfect I held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws I removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it Once removed there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate My old microwave didn't have an open space My concern was that if I heat soup it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space It still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave Oh well this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times I used on my old microwave Yes I'd purchase this again but I'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door
Great Buy Very happy with this purchase For the money great product I was a little concerned because some had mentioned the clunky door but I find no problems with it
works great looks cool I have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside It works great and looks pretty cool I was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does So it works for all my needs Maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking I do anyway so it's fine for me
Thanks Sharp Thanks Amazon We bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome The combination of an outside hood vent range light convection oven and microwave made it a bargain as well The shipping was perfect It was packed in 2 boxes first the manufacture's styro lined box then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box The stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great Thanks Sharp Thanks Amazon
average microwave It is a very compact microwave and will fit well in a tight space The power is quite low and heat things very slowly sometimes painfully slow if you have a small kitchen this will work OK but be prepared to put up with slow heating and not so easy to use controls
Perfect for NYC apartments Everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks This powerful machine is perfect for the typical Manhattan kitchen If you are looking for a stylish functional and space saving microwave then buy this one
PEM31SMSS GE Profile randomly shuts off This PEM31SMSS GE Profile Spacemaker unit intermittently powers off while cooking There seems to be a power supply issue If you unplug for a few seconds and plug back in I have to reset the clock it will work again until it powers off randomly again Not sure what is up I have contacted the Amazon seller and am awaiting instructions for returning and getting a new unit I have a old 8+ yr old full size GE Profile Spacemaker 2 that has never had any issue which I will continue to use until I get a replacement unit
Great Little Microwave I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working We wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee We needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online It is very cute and looks like an oldschool television set The controls are very simple there is no number pad you use the + and minus signs to adjust cook time This microwave also has a built in timer which was also very nice At only 750 watts it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave Although the price was higher that a comprablesized microwave the size and shape make it worth the extra money
poor quality and service This was a reeplacement purchase Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned Often requires multiple attempts to start contacted seller who defered back to GE Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor My recommendation is to avoid both vendor and productif possible
Just right I love this little microwave oven I just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners so I wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog was easy to open and easy to clean and didn't have a lot of fancy options that I never use Previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments so there's a lot of pushing the + button so I guess there's still room for improvement but it does exactly what I want it to What I particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it Very easy to wipe clean no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry
smallspace I love this microwave It is the perfect size for a small space it looks nice and it cooks well for a 750 watt The first one I received would not latch and Whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one even though I did not purchase it directly from them
no brand name on front There is no brand name of the front of this appliance which is nice because you can then pair it with your other appliances that may be a different brand Which in my case was Whirlpooljust a note Whirpool and Amana are one in the same I had it installed by a professional I do not know if it was difficult to install This is not a direct wire appliance you will need an outlet in the cupboard above in order to plug it in So far no complaints I have not had much time to use it1 week since installation
Sharp Convection Microwave My wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it I had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think I would be that impressed with this new model I was wrong This is one of the best appliances that I've ever purchased
RG Absolutely love it Takes up very little counter space large inside great height would highly recommend Purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have Many compliments from guests everyone wants to know where they can order one
Size Matters This arrived incredibly fast and features were as advertised However do be aware that the height is listed as 15 and 12 and this was a primary consideration as I was replacing a microwave in a tight space Sure enough the front is 15 and 12 however the unit slopes to 16 and 12 at the back
great affordable microwave I don't find this microwave any noisier than others I've owned I also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions So far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful Great basic affordable microwave
Fantastic replacement works Replaced an existing OTR microwave that had a burnt out magnetron It's been several months since install and I am still very happy 1 Carousel works 2 Has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 19 minute intervals Can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart 3 Nukes food up really quickly 4 Very easy to install Even with a old house I used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame Took me two hours and I was able to pop it in place all by myself 5 Vent does a good job at sucking Got it in fast and in great condition If you need a cheap replacement this is it
microwave This is a great small microwave It fits in a small area Replaces an existing This works much better Do recommend
Absolutely Love It Two days in and I couldn't be happier with this purchase Small foot print excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate It's also the quietest microwave I have ever owned You can barely hear it The LCD is super bright and the controls are so easy to use I love how the entire front sure is flat makes for really easy clean up I would so buy this again and again
Defect Apparently From The Manufacture GE Purchased this product from Warehouse Deals Fulfilled by Amazon which was advertised as USED but in GOOD condition microwave oven arrived April 28 2012 The product did not work and the door was damaged Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1 2012 who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return On May 5 2012 the parts arrived notified GE immediately and a tech representative would be responding Monday May 7 2012 I don't know if this product had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it?

Nice compact easy to use Whirlpool's description of this microwave is spot on The only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad but there really isn't space given the compact design We have oversized dinner plates and they fit in here with very little to spare which means this microwave is perfect for us
Working fine after 4 months We bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one to fit into a space in our cabinets and this was the closest A bonus was the turntable which my husband really likes It is larger inside than the old one and more powerful in the same space We have used it 4 months now with no issues at all The door does close and open rather hard so we ease it closed otherwise we love it The controls are very easy to use We had a bit of trouble installing it we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave to slip onto the bracket so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top A good choice if it becomes available again
Love it Perfect replacement for my old one It is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme I can nuke larger items now
Fits a need Bought to fit in an 18 kitchen base cabinet hidden behind a door 1000 watts would be better but this is the only choice for my requirements I like the simple controls as I use it only to rewarm leftovers and melt butter and chocolate
Cool Cooler I bought this fridge for my college son who lives on his computer The only setback is that he says it doesn't accomodate larger cans of drinks Other than that he says it is the coolest invention
Works Great I received the item before the expected datepackage and it's contents were intact no issues at all with delivery I used it the day I received it after reading the many helpful hints in these online reviews it was very simple and easy to use It works great for me for small loads in my apartmentI live alone and don't have large amounts of laundry to wash The tube they supply to fill up the tub didn't fit onto my faucet but I have a plastic pitcher I used to fill it three pitchers full easy peasy When in use it sits right on my kitchen counter and the drain tube empties the water directly into my sink The Panda is fairly quiet if I have music or the tv on I can't hear it at all It's really been a huge help to me and I use it often I am planning on getting a minielectric dryer as well then I will only have to visit the laundrymat once a month if that I highly recommend the Pandait's just so darn cute and works like a charm with small loads
Fine It is the right price but it is not the same size as it says We had the exact same one just a little older and this one was slightly smaller 14 on all sides
My Sharp R520KS2CubicFoot 1200Watt Microwave This is the first 1200 watt microwave I've ever owned It took just a while to figure out I didn't need things to heat as long but once I figured it out it is the best microwave I've ever owned The only drawback I have is I wish the completed beeper was louder Other than that I am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave
A bit noisy Everything so far seems to be working great We've only owned it for a few weeks but other than it being just a bit noisier than the old one we replaced we are very happy with it Also the power is the same as the one we replaced it for but it seems to take about 1520% longer cooking time than the old one The size of the microwave is larger than the old one so maybe that is the reason it takes longer to cook Other than that I would still buy the same microwave over again if I had to do it all over again Great deal for the money
Expensive but a good buy We bought this oven based upon our son's usage of an earlier model There aren't that many drawer microwaves available Why buy a drawer microwave? Well the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house Her arguments were as follows 1 no need to lift or inspect foods over her head 2 made space for a vent While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above top our new house didn't have any vent So all cooking fumes were vented into the room With this oven we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood above the range Still not perfectly ventalated I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker but a problem or extra costs for others In addition I had to add an electrical outlet Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer but maybe a cost for others After the installation simple enough the drawer didn't want to stay closed That is you push the close button and the drawer closed but reopened immediately I was about to call for service but I did the following push the drawer closed manually that is by hand This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay So no service call required The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table Dispite this we are happy with this model so far after about a year Shorter people may like this oven a lot and it is REALLY COOL So I would recommend this oven
Perfect for a small kitchen I love this microwave It takes up barely any space on the counter and the cord is well hidden behind it It works fine for just heating things up and defrosting The only thing to be aware of is that this really is a tiny microwave You can fit a full size dinner plate but there is not a lot of height inside I couldn't use my microwave rice cooker in this because it was too tall so I had to purchase a counter top rice cooker instead which doesn't seem to work as well Other than that this microwave looks good on the counter and does the job
2nd Try and Fail We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall The standard size is 16'deep and up Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 149' depth was this one We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model MCO160UW a second try it failed again after 1 week of use It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
Satisfied The Haier Microwave was exactly as discribed and installed easily It replaced a 10yo Hotpoint over the counter which began the fail and finally threw electrial flashes and died As a low cost replacement the Haier was the best I could find
Good product Good quality product Installed well and works great Some reviewers commented on the way the door closes but I have found it to be just fine Hopefully it will last a long time I would recommend 32013 Update The microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year Very pleased with it With lots of use and much by teenagers it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far It also cooks very efficiently Still happy and would still recommend
Very good value I ordered this Microwave to replace my 15 year old GE microwavevent hood which had finally given up the ghost after multiple repairs I was pleased that I could install it myself using the templates and instructions included It has fewer features than the expensive model it replaced but it works quite well and includes all the important features including the ability to use the existing vent or to vent into the room
Great Microwave This item works great was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen Exactly what it says in the description arrived on time We have no complaints whatsoever with this item I would definitely recommend it
Good price for basic features I bought this particular microwave oven because it would fit in the space over our stove and the price was very good It's worked well without any problems since I bought it a few months ago My only complaint is that you can't have the timer going and cook something in the microwave at the same time I've never had a microwave that couldn't do that so that's a little disappointing
Great microwave I looked everywhere for this microwave I had the same one a few years ago and wanted the same one in white because I wanted to match it with my new kitchen It is not too big nor too small It was the perfect depth for my shelf in my kitchen Reliable appliance
Not exactly what I was expecting I purchased this microwave to match other Frigidaire appliances I have with price in mind I missed that you don't have the ability to turn off the turntable on this modelit seems like that should be standard anymore If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation the turntable function can be damaged I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time I'll get used to that though It gives three long beeps when the time is up which is kind of annoying to me for some reason Even when you open the door the beeps continue I haven't used it much yet I tried the popcorn feature and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button But if I'd had more time home constructionit arrived and was installed right away and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return I would have returned it and opted for a different model It looks nice and I'm sure it will be fine
Good for a basic microwave noisy though This looks good and does what it is designed to do My main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy but as I only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal
Very disappointed with its reliability I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago Then all of a sudden in April of 2009 the unit stopped working Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food It would even make all the noise and so on So I had to replace it and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it To my horror less than 25 years later I have the exact same failure On top of this if you need any repair service they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row I will never again buy anything from GE And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly
good buy it works
Ministerdwf Wow Wow Wow I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet but how great it was I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase I know you will too
cheap and poor quality do not buy When I opened the box I saw the corner next to the push button was lose The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front everything else is either painted metal and plastic  I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer
Great inexpensive OTR microwave The first time I used it I was disappointed with it but I don't know if it just got better or if I pushed the wrong button the first time because it's been great since Nice and roomy interior easy to install I did it completely by myself though I recommend you have a friend I did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first so I had to take it down to do that but once you get the frame mounted on the wall that part is easy The hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above I'm not sure how they could have made it any easier though the problem is mostly a matter of physics  I would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range
Poor Quality After 1 year of light use maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything The cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth
It's fine three years later I have had this microwave three years The only problem I ever have with it is that the door sticks sometimes I just have to tug on it every once in a while The oven works consistently and does everything it should The defrost stops intermittently to tell you to turn things over or separate them or whatever That is sometimes helpful and sometimes not If I have just one chicken breast in there to defrost I have to hit the button to resume defrost about three or four times I do respond by turning the chicken over one of those times I defintely recommend the microwave
Great addition to our kitchen The GE Profile countertop microwave 22 cuft is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items Very satisfied with our purchase
Mixed Feelings Update After 16 months we have the same problem as others It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off Original Review I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical However I can rate the features and design of the unit I like the size the power and the large turntable The controls however were poorly designed For example to cook at anything other than full power you need to press the power level repeatedly The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10% So to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button
Very disapointed I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA Different issues Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory I won't purchase another sharp microwave The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely I'm not happy at all
Microwave paint fix that works My daughter had a GE microwaveoven combo The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work To my amazement it did Now it wasn't easy I had to degrease the inside of the oven TSP then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid I used PaintStriper sanding blocks 60 and 100 grit the followed up with some 150 grit paper Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape paper and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray Pro Followed the directions on the can and sprayed away It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later So about $35 in material has so far stopped a very expensive hundreds of dollars oven replacement Cons The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house The paint does dry very fast in about an hour
great product Great product Fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm Sleek and effective
Stopped working after 2 months The microwave looks good but stopped heating after 2 months I am on hold now with Sharp customer service The space saving design is nice but don't like waiting for the drawer to openclose The controls being 4' off the ground are tempting for my 3yr old
outstanding this microwave is incredible very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great easy to use and to clean
Outstanding My Sharp drawer microwave is so much more than I even hoped for It is convenient The button to open and button to close OR easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself Love that I had to REPROGRAM myself to go easy to get it opening or closing then let it finish all by itself I was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 12 second that I used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut It's good for me to slow down for 2 seconds There are more single cook options than I have used yet I really like the push START once to get one minute cook time 2 pushes for 2 minutes etc Can do the same to add a minute while cooking SENSOR REHEAT and SENSOR COOK buttons are useful but as in prior microwaves I have to still keep a check on how it's cooking It seems to cook evenly but I probably will get a windup turntable if I can still find one  It holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare The 1000W power cooks fast Love it Love it Love it
Perfect For My Needs I wanted a microwave that took up as little counter space as possible had sensor cooking and was easy to use This one fit all that criteria and had a bonus a Beverage key which I use a lot to heat water to the perfect temp for tea This microwave is perfect for my needs and I'm very happy with it The only downside is that the quality is only average
Small and Underpowered The box was somehow very light and right then I knew we had made a mistake   This microwave is almost like a toy It is very tiny and underpowered We unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn Well it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop After 34 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped Forget it It must have been broken or maybe just for making things warm not hot  We returned it right away Speedy return system
Great Cusomer Service This unit is a replacement for an identical item that arrived with concealed damage I notifed Amazon around 3pm the day it arrived and received word that a replacement unit had been ordered and it would take several days to process the order Two hours later I received notification that the replacement unit had been shipped It arrived at 915 the next morning Outstanding customer service effort by Amazon  This microwave replaced a 2002 Sharp model identical in size power and other features The first thing I noticed is that it takes 30% to 40% longer to heat compared to the older model even after 8 years of use This is across the board not just on certain items Also the keypad has been reconfigured with the start and stop buttons situated in between rows of other buttons instead of separated from other buttons as on the older model The buttons are also smaller and it is easy to push the wrong button if you get in a hurry I will say it is a more attractive unit and a lot quieter than the older model
Not Recommended Door broke near the handle in less than one year Had the door replaced under warranty Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year but now it's out of warranty New door costs over $100 Serious design or manufacturing flaw I can't recommend this microwave Very disappointed
After much research online After our old Microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores I purchased Consumer Reports for microwaves and then searched for them on Amazon to read the customer reviews The top ten rated had horrible customer reviews So then decided to search from the bottom of the list up and this is when I found our next microwave Loud was the only beef with this microwave Now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave Basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud But the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast even heat with the turning tray is awesome This is used several times a day and after a month no complaints
Sharp Microwave My husband I were looking for a microwave for my daughter her husband for a Christmas gift This is the same brand that we have are very happy w it This is exactly what we were looking for so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price Their home is nearing completion they are so excited to install this microwave start using it Our daughter said that she just loves the modern look knows that it'll look wonderful w all their other stainless steal appliances
An excellent product at a great price We've owner this product for several years now It looks nice and works great Amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don't need to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition
purchased on a whim As good or better than i hoped Lots of options fan is great It is noisier than my old one as per other reviews but reallyit doesn't matter that much
Amazing Microwave We have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it Well worth the price It is super convenient you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven Cooks evenly and quickly Easy to use and clean Very attractive a conversation piece as well
Maybe best MicroConvection built After owning a previous Sharp microwaveconvection oven I bought this one Installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed Excellent even microwave and oven performance Highly recommend this product
Nice Looking Good Customer Service So Far The installation dimensions in the install guide are exactly right I worried about trusting them but they worked very well  Looks real nice works well and was very easy to install  One issue When the drawer closed it made a squeeking sound I figured it was going back into the box and getting shipped back We called Sharp and they sent out a technician who diagnosed the problem and ordered a replacement part We'll have to update if things go south with that but so far I appreciated the customer service  Four stars because of the squeaking drawer but not one star because the customer service was so good
Great Microwave Microwave is very spacious works well and is very powerful We love this unit Arrived with faulty circuit card would not heat up Sharp Warranty personnel were here within 2 days and fixed it
Everything Microwave Right size cooks everything Fast and convenient Just right for my needs Can't go wrong with the deal or the unit
Very Pleased Excellent price and product 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime another really good investment This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave which was useless from day one It fits well very secure mounts and easy to use template Oven itself is easy to use quiet powerful excellent venting in our case out the top to the roof Everything has been easy to clean so far including the buttons and window I put it in myself but two person job would have been a better choice Really like the sensor cooking so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time Definitely recommend this oven
REVIEW MAGIC CHEF THIS IS AWESOME LOVE IT IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY VERY HAPPY OVERALL
Decent lowcost over the range This unit was a replacement for a slightly earlier model that failed It is nice that the LG overtherange family generally uses the same wallmount so installation was easy as a replacement  It works fine though if you are a heavy users of microwaves I am not sure what the real durability is but since we are light users the prior model lasted several years and expect this will too
Sharp Microwave Review The Microwave works beautifully The installation instructions left something to be desired but we figured it out
Microwave It's great This black LG overtherange microwave is just what we needed It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly  We're happy customers
Sitting in My Garage We bought this from Amazon in July No issues Installed it and it worked greatfor less than 4 months The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving Called factory service 2 weeks The appointment is scheduled for 812 They show up at 1155 They stay until 200yup it's broke but we need parts and 2 people 2 more weeks parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here Factory service that doesn't have partsinteresting way to do business They show up at 1158seriously Two hours and another vacation day burned and the replacement parts are defective Warm fuzzynot Two more weeksand they canceled their appointment Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one  So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire  I have emailed Whirlpoolwill update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved  Thinking of buying this branditemsave yourselfdon't   Update 122809 Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed they will not replace their defective equipment So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up   The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen It is a Sharp Bare bones model but it works Santa is a wise man  Ohand where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's? The garage  February 28after 5 more appointments2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave We have the new one 3 days I do enjoy this microwave I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable   If you have problems keep good records stay with factory authorized service and be persistent
Terrible quality I am changing my five star to a one star review The product cooked food well but despite gentle use we read reviews here noting a cracked door our door has cracked then cracked again and then the handle itself has snapped off The material quality is very poor We were very gentle with this unit but it's simply a very low quality product Absolutely do not purchase this
Good Family size Microwave This Sharp Microwave is Great for a Family Its Large size is a big plus Easy operation and nice finish and very powerful  We had an LG oven before and it is a JUNK It lasted only 2 years Our old Microwave was a Sharp also and its still working after 20+ years My rating A+++
good basic microwave I bought this microwave to replace my previous Sharp R1449 This one is deeper more plastic and slightly more powerful It seems reliable only have had it 6 weeks has a good vent and good stove lights I wish it had a night light and a switch to stop turntable rotation though one can get around it by removing the turntable My biggest disappointment was that it utilizes a different mounting plate than my previous Sharp microwave  I gave it four stars bc it does the job and it was inexpensive compared to other manufacturers Incidentally mounting instructions were very good
Gorgeous Efficient and Chic This microwave is wonderful The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use If you read Consumer Reports it says this or similiar microwave has only a useful space of 09 cubic feet Not so This has a full 20 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish Very sharp design useful and adequate lighting underneath For the installationdoityourselfers It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove Follow the instructions to the letter and all will turn out great The directions are very good Note If you can remove your stove before installing the microwave The mfgr doesn't mention this but it made things a lot easier and I got to clean under it233 preferred people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size I recommend this microwave highly
Decent oven inexpensive not too bad to install I bought this oven to replace a Whirlpool of equal size I like the LG It's a little more powerful and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well It's a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts Get those right and the installation is no big deal It does take two people to horse this 60 lb appliance into place while starting the bolts threading the cord etc  It took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and I was a cabinet installer in my youth Still no big deal  Tip use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet
over the range microwave The microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition We have tested it to make sure it works It was just installed so we haven't used it a lot yetcompletely happyexcellent Amazon service as usual
microwell report This appliance works much better than my last sharp As for noise complaint I didn't find it to much different than my old microwave Only bad part about stainless steel is that you see all the fingerprints everywhere Really liked the speedy service
Deliberated long hard 520KS Great Choice After too much research I settled on this terrific microwave Every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunctionno help horror story So in the end if you chance having a microwave at all this one seems better than most if not all It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars At home and work they have been dependable efficient good looking and inexpensive Both the 20 and 14 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles When I designed my kitchen twenty years ago I made two belowcounter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily They have been great workhorses The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances including Bosch dual fuel slidein range the dream machine and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R408LS Carousel 14 cubic foot1100W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's $99 as a replacement The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot1200W with Sharp's R520KS microwave as well The display pads are lightly different but better than losing size in the 14 cu ft The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably including the rounded window corners My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition Knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term I can only say they are 5+ stars as weekold additions to my kitchen The microwaves do everything I want powerfully and quickly The cost especially with Amazon Prime shipping closed the deal
Delighted overall For the price I don't think you can beat this Sharp microwave I just wanted a basic microwave that did the job I was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and I was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the Sharp would be inadequate My fears were groundless as the Sharp functions every bit as fast the older one I like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle They recommend two people to mount this oven however since I didn't have help available I was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought If I were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas mainly in the venting info Allinall a good buy
Sharp Over the Range Convection Microwave Oven You will be surprised at the amount and size of food this oven will accomodate It cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices I bought this because my other Sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use I was used to the Sharp features which made it the logical choice At the same time I wanted to replace my conventional oven also 11 yrs old because it never baked evenly With the Sharp microconvection combo I no longer have to replace my conventional range oven I'll use it for storage
Great Microwave I highly recommend it I bought the Sharp R520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving I did alot of research before I bought this one I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house Now I had an excuse to replace it I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in and this one had some of the best reviews a decent price and the stainless steel look I wanted I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one This microwave works great I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons It has some nice features like the hot water button you tell it how many cups to heat minute plus button keep warm setting and many others I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most There are sensor heating buttons reheat buttons and defrost buttons although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet The ones I have used so far work great My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's the buttons all look the same and the startminute plus button and stopcancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly Not too much of an issue but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon The microwave is also pretty large so you can fit alot in there I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time All in all this microwave works great looks great and was reasonablypriced I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking powerful counter top microwave
Sharp R1406 micrave I had a same model of microwave which worked for me about  4to 5 years very good and that was the reason I ordered the same brand and model again  the new one so far has been very good too but the one way blocking door over the exhaust fan was noisy which I swapped it with the older one and fixed the problem overall is very good and I like it
works great this was a great buy I read the other reviews and they are right on the money Easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great
turntable plate horrible After one year the turntable plate cracked while we were making a bag of popcorn Very strange indeed Now trying to find a replacement as I really miss the food items turning while cooking Other than that it is still working in top notch condition UPDATE This microwave died after only 2 years Was hoping to get more out of it then we did
Darn Door I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut I had to send it back Darn Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem I am pleased with Amazon's service
sharp microwave Great help in the installation smaller oven size than ge or sears Display could have larger numbers No handle to open door
A fine microwave at a fantastic price Love it Love it Love it My Sharp microwave of 10 years finally died It had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape We looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from This one was built with the same quality as my old one and I don't doubt it will last as long
good but large microwave This microwave works pretty good The sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly The only bad thing I've seen is that it's got a rather large footprint
Great Product from Amazon We really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from Amazon It really has a good convection oven although is somewhat noisy with the fan It was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions Amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere
Great Microwave Even Greater Amazon Service This is a great microwave especially with the $25 discount Amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over $125 But let me tell you why this purchase was extra special I was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered size weight fragile etc rather than from a local store  But the selection at local stores like Best Buy was so bad I placed the order Unfortunately the day it was supposedly delivered by UPS no microwave arrived I called UPS to see if I could start a tracer but UPS told me that Amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package I went to the customer service site couldn't find a phone number and used the email system I thought great that email will disappear into the ether I may never hear from anybody and here I am without my microwave That was about 8pm local time when I sent the email  The next morning when I checked my email I got quite a surprise An Amazon rep wrote back apologized my package had been lost and reordered the item for me Before too long I had an email the item was already shipping via 2day delivery and sure enough 2 days later I had the replacement package Wow No hassle no waiting just great service I couldn't believe it I don't think I'll ever hesitate when I want to order something from Amazon again I don't work for Amazon they're not paying for this I've actually never written a product review before I was just so impressed with the customer service I had to write  The final chapter the day before the replacement microwave arrived the person who lives in the next culdesac over from us with the same house number and with a street name similar to ours showed up with the original microwave that UPS had mistakenly delivered to them I wrote Amazon customer service an email and once again after a very quick response I was able to arrange for UPS to come pick up the extra package Thanks Amazon You're great
Pleased I did not follow advise of other review I love this I bought this on Amazon to replace a Sharp microwave which has served me well for several years Based on the price compared to other with similar features this unit is the least expensive I was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation I am closer to being Tim the toolman Taylor than a professional at home improvements so I followed the instructions with precision The results were outstanding Not only does it look GREAT where my old stove hood used to be it passed my popcorn test of which I am particular No scotching full bag satisfying and an extra plus while I am beaming over my accomplishment the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished the display read Enjoy Am I ever I have in my digital lockercourtesy of Amazon my own pdf manual What a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit Solidly built looks great came with lightbulbs for range light INSTALLED No cons but could have used some help with installing as the manual recommends 2 people install but I did manage nicely by myself I would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion once preparations are complete I have only owned this for a day but I wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive if they are on the edge to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket Panasonic wants like $300 for a comparable unit I am pleased to pay 12 as much and get a quality unit such as this You can even get this for $25 off before January 31st free shipping this dude is HEAVY and no tax do the math it is a steal
It was a bit of a disappointment When we were remodeling our kitchen we decided to replace our Sharp countertop convection microwave with the over the range model I really miss the old one This new model seems to be a lot noisier than the old one I went from 15 cubic feet down to 11 and it feels like I lost a lot more room than that The hood light is VERY dim and the replacement bulbs 2 each cost at least $4 a piece if you can find them Because we had to vent this into the kitchen we had to sent away to Sharp for a charcoal filter that cost $20 filter plus shipping and handling We had planned to vent it to the outside but the vent didn't even come close to matching up the hole from our former range hood The cooking turntable is white and very had to keep clean It is only a month old and is very stained already  I do like to have the cooking area at eye level  I researched the price for comparable items on the web before buying and Amazon offered the best price as well as free shipping I am very pleased with Amazon
Bargain??? Mind the interior One week after installing this overthestove convection microwave the stainless steel interior began to look spotted A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it He concluded the metal interior's defect whereupon Sharp said they would replace but not pay for reinstallation of the unit Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140 That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online Sharp's customer service will not compensate I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this Live and learn It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement said to be on backorder but still available online  Aside from the interior cosmetic defect the microwave looks great and works fine
Great microwave little tough to mount Its a pretty big and heavy unit so having someone around to help mount would be a good thing I found that sometimes the clips in the back have a little trouble popping in all the way unless its lined up just right I didnt like the wall mount screws a whole lot as well as the fact there is only 4 to hold on the whole bracket they note that you should have at least 2 in studs They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across so what I did was located two studs drilled some 116th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk 5 1 34quot drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place the bit can easily destroy the screw hole  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 12quot self tapping bolts So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall As for functionality the microwave is nice and powerful the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door you punch in the settings when you open it A note of caution dont put anything in it without the carousel tray to heat I had a small paper nacho bowl in there and it almost started the glue on fire in 20 seconds Another note The carousel tray does not ship in this box well mine arrived broken in half My only option was to ship the whole unit back weighs like 80 lbs I lucked out because my old microwave was a Sharp and the carousel tray is identical
Sharp could be Sharper UPDATE Yes i too had the door latch button melt and it does not function any longer it actually was replaced within the 1st year under warranty but now this has happened again a second time and i was only boiling water on the front burner i see no use in paying for a second repair since i am currently using a pen to pop the door open i will of course have to replace the whole microwave in the near future i will be soooo happy when i finally do i can't wait to ditch this appliance what a waste next time I'm choosing a regular handle not a push button latch Live Learn  don't they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumerwon't be buying anything from sharp company any time soon  I purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model emerson proffesional stainless steel I needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances I purchased it from Amazon for $275 lowest price I could find and am currently waiting on a $30rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal It has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier My countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid $100 for it on all sides not just the front like this model I installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability Exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low settingwish it was quieterThe light has hi and low settings either is bright enough more of a night light feature Overall it work fine and looks good Not a high end unit but then again not a high end price It does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked used it on potatoes which turned out greatAt first I was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through UPS for fear it would arrive damaged but UPS did a fine job with handling Rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating
